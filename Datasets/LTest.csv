0,"Finally: Finally! This is finally here as sought after for so many years. There are so many fine reviews here that I need not repeat them, but let the music speak for itself.Ant Phillips is one of the only tried and true, and I and a whole lot of others bow to him for valuing his values and yet being quite active in this very disdainful world that we've created.I would take my hat off to you Anthony, but the glare, my god, the glare!",1
1,I hate this printer: Goes through ink too fast. Uses color ink somehow when I only print black text. Doesn't play well with some of my computers on the network. I wish I hadn't bought this printer.,0
2,"Waste of money: With every conceivable test of different print seetings I tried, even Kodak's ""recommended"" settings, this paper came out terribly, especially in photgraphs that had a lot of black. The black ink clumps, leaving a lot of crackly marks. Don't waste your money.",0
3,wow what a movie: this is not in my to 10 movies of all time but it is a very good si-fi movie. very well made and looks good. well worth the time to watch it,1
4,"Not just for youths!: I agree with all of the reviews saying that this is an excellent resource for our youth. But I have to tell you that it was an excellent resource for ME at 45 years old. I loved having answers that I could not only understand, but could remember long enough to share with others! Now I don't have to just ""take it on faith"", I can actually get it!",1
5,"Quick & Easy: I read the reviews for this DVD before I'd actually purchased it and I LOVE IT! I have other yoga videos, but I love Ellen and she's a great teacher. But over the course of one week, you will definitely see results, NO JOKE. But this only comes with eating right and doing it CONSISTENTLY. I definitely recommend this and it fits into my time well, being I work full time. The reason why Pilates works is because it focuses on the smaller muscles and tones from there. This is a great video though...I'll recommend it to those who are just getting started.",1
6,"A CD FILLED WITH MAGICAL BEATS: ""Only in My Dreams"" is Shayla first American CD working with Global sound! After listening to this CD I was very happy that Shayla represented us asian-american society. Her CD featured many famous artist such as Martin Nievera, KaLa'I Miller and her own mom Thanh Tuyen. All the songs in this CD were written with passion. The lyrics are emotional and deep. The beats and rhymth are magical stars! A different and unique taste of music! SHayla also co-produced three songs: Only in my dreams, Open up your Heart, and Thank U. This is a CD perfect for this type of season! Maurice Starr and Matt Young have created a new fantastic artist to the music chart. Buy this CD, you won't regret it!",1
7,"Buy another microwave.: Bought this microwave in April. It's now broken. Bad smell then it stopped working. Simple as that. Last microwave we had lasted at least a decade not 7 months. Moreover, as a test I also bought a SquareTrade warranty. Useless. Because the microwave lasted less than a year it's still covered by the manufacturers warranty which, it turns out, is SquareTrades virtual deductible.",0
8,"Best Of 2002 List: #11: Conor Oberst makes folk music...emo folk music. His stories are long-winded, for sure, but never to the point where they will bore you so long as you are in the right mood. This should be no problem in your late teens to early 20's because chances are you will almost *always* be in the right mood. And as with many folkies before him, I have no doubt that Conor's music will get older as he does (I despise the word ""mature""). If his tales of attempted suicide and the fruitless search for a perfect love don't make you cry in your bed at night, they will certainly comfort you while you do. We have found a new boy for the critics to call Bob Dylan, let us pray he doesn't disappoint us like the others.",1
9,"A Good Primer, Excellent Bibliography: The Q&A format of the book makes it easy to get some basic background knowledge of what is to many a completely mysterious - and misunderstood - subject. As the Questions and Answers are not arranged ""in sequence"" one need not read the book from front to back - each is handled as if no other entries have been reviewed, and all are listed in the Index for ""quick review."" The bibliography is an excellent source for continuing education and review. Mr. Esposito handily lays out some answers using comparisons and/or contrasts between other religions - the format that many readers will no doubt be looking for in their quest to begin understanding ""what Islam is all about."" A very good place to start.",1
10,"A disapointing book: I really have to say that I was disapointed with this book. The writing became longwinded and boring, and the story just seemed to drag on and on. Of Millett's four stories, this plot was by far the worst--the whole thing was based on the sexual preferences of two men.The other big problem I have with the Secret Alliance is that it doesn't really involve Holmes at all. The main character is clearly Shadwell Rafferty, which is not exactly what I was expecting. The long portions taken from Watson's diary were added so Millett could call it a Holmes story. The writing from Watson's diary is extremly boring and hard to read, since little of it actually involves the story.",0
11,"Dis' Cd Is Off Da Hinges!!: Yo, if you aint heard or bought dis cd yet, go out and buy it and hear it fo real! Dis cd is definitely a fine example of how tight down south rap is. ""Smoke One"" is a real tight smokin song. Spread da word! This cd is one of the best out there. Check it!",1
12,"Been using them for years, love them.: I've had these for about 4 years, used only for PC headphones and I'm glad I picked them up. They've been thrown around and been great with zero issues during that time. I bought purely based on price point and had no idea how good they were. They were roughly $30ish at the time.It was a chance buy and I struck lucky. They're as light & comfortable as others here say all day long. They provide great sound for the price. I'm sure I'd like some $100-$200 headphones, but until these fail me I can't really justify an upgrade.",1
13,"I love the bean game!: The bean game is fun for kids of all ages. As a graduate student I spent the last weekend with several other hyper-educated individuals, who all found the bean game to be captivating.What is most captivating is that really this game is about your ability to communicate and cooperate with the other players. I highly recommend this game!",1
14,"The Magic Flute: The DVD transfer of The Magic Flute is indeed magic. I have seen this wonderful film at the cinema, via television and on two VHS tapes, one PAL and one NTSC. Not until this DVD have I seen Bergman's Flute in all its glory. It is superb - and the new stereo PCM soundtrack is especially wonderful because it lets us hear, for the first time, how good these singers really are. But... There is always a but!The sound channels are transposed. They are back to front. The left is in the right and vice versa.It is such a pity to get so near to perfection and just miss the goal.",1
15,Beautiful book: I bought this book for my 10yo grandson. He loves tofix in the kitchen............he read it cover to coveras soon as he got it. So it does hold a childs intrest.He loved the illustrations and pictures.He seemed inspired to get started. I thought the directions easy to follow and there are a varietyof recipes in all catagories. Thank you.,1
16,"Good Mp3 Player!: This is very good. Sound is so good. I recommend strongly.Actually at the first time, it didn't work, so i return it,and recieve again very quickly. The new one works well.I like it.",1
17,"poor, poor: This book is embarrassing. In my opinion the Vault Career Guide to Marketing and Brand Management is a superior guide to careers in marketing. Good luck.",0
18,"great all in one unit: great unit. only real shortfall is price. easy to setup and configure. all secutity can be handled from the web interface, providing you know the mac addresses of your systems. it took me about 6 minutes to setup. i did experience a similar problem of random dropping from one of my laptops, but was able to nail that down to the card in that laptop as no other units had a problem. supporting a mixed network is great as well. the TIVO really doesnt need 54g.i would recommend this to anyone who has familiarity with wireless networks, and doesnt expect the unit to hand hold a novice through the setup.",1
19,"Good Basic Gun book: If you need just a quick and dirty ""appraisal"" of your firearms, this is the place to go. You can see in an instant if you are getting the best price for your firearms, or if someone is trying to rip you off! All of the manufacturers options are listed too, so don't believe the guy that tells you he paid extra for an option that doesn't even exist. This is a good place to start, for beginners to experts. Well laid out, easy to find info.",1
20,"Too much Jerry, not enough Cherokees: I was deeply disappointed by this book. Jerry Ellis takes himself and his so-called ""insights"" waaaay too seriously. It is hard to accept his ""link"" with his Cherokee ancestors when he had the luxury of clean beds, fresh food, and freedom of choice. It is an insult to their suffering for him to compare his journey with theirs. This book is a ""Blue Highways"" wannabe that doesn't make it.",0
21,"One star heaven? Yes for this release sure.: I would have thought New Line/WB would have learned after the last fiasco (the third release that actually included both versions and more extra's) alas they have no brains. Hard Core LOTR fans might pick this up as a collectors item. But I really have a distaste for the censored versions of the film. I'd stay far far away from this opus of a rip of. $68??? True Blood is cheaper. X_XKeep Those nice DVD massive Box sets, that and they upconvert great and usually have DTS on them.I only will figure the hard core collector will buy this. But one doesn't make money on hard core fans.",0
22,"The Make-Up Book: This book is really a must have for any and all people that wear or apply make-up. It shows you a wide array of techniques, color uses, and how NOT to waste your money on tools. If you want only one book about make-up, to learn everything, and not to spend too much, this is the book to get.",1
23,stylus: The stylus actually matches my kindle cover and is lightweight and easy to use. No more messy fingerprints on the display screen.,1
24,"Spiral slicer: I have only used the slicer on two occasions. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I picked a hard tuber, sweet potatoes for my first try. The directions could be a bit better, but i think I am going to love it. I would recommend it to anyone who is living raw or even just vegetarian. I am looking forward to using it again.",1
25,"This is not just my favorite Harry Connick Jr. album...: it's my favorite album from any artist. It's not traditional Connick, if that's what you're looking for, but if give his funk sound a chance- it's wonderful, and great fun.",1
26,"You get what you pay for: If you're looking for inexpensive binoculars, don't complain when they don't work like a $300 pair of binoculars. I got these for the sole purpose of my kids having some to play with when we go camping. For the price, they're GREAT!!! They actually see very well. Even my husband and I use them. I would strongly recommend these to anyone looking for some cheap binoculars.",1
27,"2nd Best of the Series: Don't believe the griping of some of the readers crying for an end to the series. This book advances almost all of the major plotlines, and most of the minor as well. Jordan's series has always had a concentration on how the events affect the chararacters. That is why the characters and events affect the readers. This book is a perfect match of new events and the effects on the characters that we love. This volume is also FULL of suprises. Wondering who Demondred is? Read the book? How about Orangar? It's in there! Ready for fulfillments of Prophesy, and events you thought were books away....Read on!",1
28,1 of the best of all time.: Stunning special effects and awesome martial arts sequences! A work of cenimatic art. A true must see adventure for all hardcore fans.,1
29,Excellent Read: This book is a wonderful resource and guide for my teens. They have read it and love it. I highly recommend it to those of you with children entering or already in high school!,1
30,"Science fiction for pre school children: The title of this review says exactly how I feel about this novel.The two heroes are sent in a spaceships to a nearby star to find habitable planets. They find humans there!. there is no explanation whatsoever how this has occurred, no new ideas, no antastic setting or fantastic aliens and no interesting plot. It feels like a bedtime story to be told to children. A complete waste of effort.",0
31,"Excelent!: Este producto esta perfecto, lo compre para poder usarlo con mi k550i y funciona de maravilla, es mucho mejor con el adaptador porque, por ejemplo mi laptop y otros card holders aun no traen un entrada para M2, pero si para Pro Duo, asi k no necesitas siempre conectarte con los cables del celular, es mucho mas comodo y asi puedes usar tu memoria en otros dispositivos que aun admiten Pro Duo, como otros celulares o camaras. Es un excelente Producto.",1
32,"Essentially a demo - Rosetta & Berlitz much superior: This is essentially a demo, perhaps really a ""bait and switch"" as noted in an earlier review. Be especially cautious if ""Stroll"" or ""Internet Order LLC"" or ""pimsleurapproach.com"" are involved in **any way**; read the fine print meticulously or you may end up in an involuntary subscription you don't want.I've used Rosetta for Spanish and Berlitz for Italian; they are superior, IMHO.",0
33,"Wife and I both thought this movie was boring.: Don't let the good reviews steer you into buying this movie. The bad acting, the bad plot and script and pretty much everything about this movie left us feeling like we wasted our time watching it. And we generally like most movies. I hope I can get a dollar for it at our garage sale.",0
34,typically boring: this story has the America F**K Yeah hero big man. The stereotype tough Russian (a paranoid relic from the cold war) chic side kick. the whole novel reads like the cover of national lampoons vacation DVD. The predator creatures could have been interchangeable with any easily dispatched villain. Am I supposed to believe that a hunter with 800 years of experience is that easily taken out by troglodyte with room temperate I.Q? I am sure this was written by a teenager.,0
35,"Weak and sad attempt from Collins: Let me just say I love Jackie Collins. I will always buy her novels no matter what but there is a distinct difference from the old school novels she used to write to today's Jackie Collins books. First, where is the sex? Second, it ways always fun to try and figure out who the characters were based on...Warren Beatty, J. Lo, now it just seems the characters are not really based on any celebrity figures anymore. This novel was weak with a storyline involving a family that I couldn't care less about. The villian in the story was not that compelling and I didn't care about the lovestruck couple Jett and Amy. I don't know if the other reviewers have read all of her stuff but I have and was entirely disappointed. This book took me a week to read and usually I finish her books in a day because they are so exciting. This one was tough to finish, Jackie, tough to finish.",0
36,MOTHER LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I bought this for my 91 year old Mother and she loves always knowing what time it is - the day of the week - the date and whether it's night or daytime. She had started calling me about 3:30 in the morning thinking it was the afternoon and she would be embarrassed. I would tell her it was fine and that I was glad she was o.k. but this clock totally stopped those calls. She had me to put up a bright yellow post-a-note by the AM light and she can always tell when it's daytime. This is a wonderful gift for your aging loved-one. Thanks Dynamic Living!,1
37,"THIS IS WHY YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC: This album is hands down the best heavy album I have heard in years. It is a symphonic blast of melodic aggression with suburb lyrics and played to precision. Killswitch Engage could only dream to be this good, (not to mention I love KE). This CD sets a new standard and reminds everyone why they listen to metal.This is of course only one man's opinion, everyone has different tastes, but in my opinion it is the best album I have ever heard!",1
38,"Interesting and representative selection: It resulted quite nice to me to listen to all this selection of songs that were very popular during 1975. Some of them are more famous pieces than the others but everyone bring to our mind lovely memories of those years inavoidably passed through...Recording process is original, the sound is really good and some melodies are particularly beautiful (""Sad sweet dreamer"", ""How long"", ""Fly, Robin fly"" or ""All by itself"", for instance) and not easy to find in CD. Very recommendable...",1
39,"Hanson Similarity: I think gameface is a _really_ good band, and I don't know if i noticed it before hearing the new Hanson, but the vocals on this album on the Gameface tracks sounds mysteriously like Taylor from everyone's favorite teen-pop-stars Hanson. But despite that frightening coincidence, it's my one of my favorite albums, and well worth the money.",1
40,"Ed Edd n Eddy: Originally bought this game when I was around 9, and lost my copy years ago while stuck on world 2. Now I am 19, bought another copy, and I still can't get past world 2! Maybe it's because I'm not a hardcore gamer, but this game is hard. It's fun because it's Ed Edd n Eddy, but this game requires a good deal of time. I recommend it though if you are an Ed Edd n Eddy fan.",1
41,Exactly what I wanted: I purchased this for a child's birthday. It arrived even faster than promised and the little girl is delighted that now she can boil eggs without worrying whether they are done or not. Great gift for a beginning cook (or an old cook).,1
42,"Never an IPOD believer..now I'm sold: I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear, sharp pictures on it. I'm sold! Also, all those folks who advise how this thing scratches, etc. I don't buy it. I've thrown this around my car, my pocket..all over the place. It shows some fingerprints, but that's about it. No scratches, no broken screens, nothing except cystal clear sound a crystal clear display. I love my IPOD Nano. Great job Apple!",1
43,"The triumph of evil: I went to see this movie because I was intrigued by the creepy creatures shown in the previews and the mystery of what had happened to the town. What I got was a sick, demonic revenge fantasy, with several scenes of disgusting and disturbing violence that I find difficult to get out of my mind. Although some of the creatures are truly unique, creepy, and well rendered, and the use of sound and music to affect mood are pretty good, everything else about the movie is just horrible. A grotesque caricature of religious fundamentalism, scenes of horrible violence, and a conclusion that offers not even the slightest shred of redemption for any of the characters, just the total triumph of evil, hatred, violence, and death. Reprehensible trash.",0
44,"Refund please!: Okay, this would have been fine if I had been in High School and it was produced by some of my buddies. However, this is not the case. It was the worse acting and writing that I've ever had the displeasure to watch. For example, they hear a loud sound and run to the top of a hill. One of the actors stands looking at the source of the sound in amazement while the other actor looks at him wondering what he's looking at...as if he couldn't see the huge OCEAN right in front of him. I guess I'm SOL in getting my money back!",0
45,"Outdated: A word of warning. . .computer graphics books age like milk, not wine. The graphics here are considerably _worse_ than what you'd get out of a consumer grade product like Metacreations Poser-- not to mention 3D Studio or Softimage.At the time this was written, it may have been useful, but you can spend your time and money more productively now.",0
46,"Stop selling this game and Don't buy this game, either.: This product and all other copies of this game title are defective and if you have purchased this title recently you will want to contact EA Games for a warranty replacement. New copies aren't being produced and the servers have been shut down, meaning there is no EA support for the game. Dealers of this product need to take it off their shelves and potential buyers need to read this review before wasting time buying it.",0
47,"Cat is the ultimate experiance: Cats has been seen in 20 some countries by over 48 millon people, even if youre not a cat person you cant help but love the music w/ Michal Grubber, Jo Gibb, Byrn Walters And Elaine Paige. The dancing and singing is spectacular!!!!",1
48,Thomas the Train: A must have with your Thomas collection. Easy to hook up with other trains and very durable.,1
49,"This is a very small kitchen set: I purchased this item for a family camping trip, however, it is so small, that it really is only good for a one person camping trip. Not worth 32.00. So think again, before purchasing it.",0
50,"Dont buy it: As soon as I opened the box I knew I wasted my money. Listen to the other reviews, not worth a dime!!!!!",0
51,Great!: Super BooK! I found here everything I needed!!! Everything! Even the most unknown radio stations!I even found a record store! It doesn't matter where you live because it has everything!,1
52,"NOT THE BOOK ADVERTISED NOT THE SCRIPT VERSION: The is ridiculous . The book advertised was the blue cover script, the one received is a red cover and not the script. I will be asking for a refund . I thought the last reviewer had given this seller a heads up notifying them of the problem but I guess the seller is not honest .",0
53,I LOVE THIS!: I love this stroller -- it has really helped me feel more confident about getting out with my twins. I also love the fact that it will fit in my Mazda Protege (something not many double strollers will do). I find it easy to fold and to carry with me. I even use it in the house so my twins can see what I am doing when I am cooking or folding clothes. It is easy to drive and very light weight.,1
54,"Not a real jelly roll pan: I would give this pan I higher rating, only it isn't really a jelly roll pan. It's just another cookie sheet. A real jelly roll pan has square straight sides, which this pan doesn't. It's the right size, but just not what I was hoping for. Plus, it had a big dent in the side when I got it. I never got to try it out baking wise because I sent it straight back to the store. I guess I should have looked at the picture closer.",0
55,"Pat Hutchins is a genius: I first fell in love with Pat Hutchins after ""reading"" her wordless book, Changes Changes. I have since purchased her other books that remain in print after nearly 30 years. I missed out on these, somehow, in my childhood, but luckily they are still around today to show my own son just how important a great book can be. Simple stories, detailed illustrations create wonderful books that will last for generations to come.",1
56,"STOP MESSING UP THE CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is the WORST Disney sequel on earth!!! Instead of a FULL movie, it turned into being THREE different stories, written by Cinderella's stupid little rat-friends.I thought it was very annoying how they got sarcastic sometimes... (Like when Gus gasps in fright when he sees a can of Prunes.) Like I said: ""STOP MESSING UP THE CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP MESSING UP THE CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP MESSING UP THE CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",0
57,Happy Customer: Great movie . Dvd shows prefect . I say buy it if you love Romantic movies like this . Loving,1
58,didnt work to good for me..: I took these for a week and they didn't work for me..I went to the bathroom...but it wasn't like what I thought it was..jus a lil came out..,0
59,"Moved to tears by this book, a heirloom forever: Alice in Agony is an insperational introduction to the beauty of soap opras. This book requires an ability to read, but no other mental capabilitys. This is definatly fodder for the dog. Bronze this book, don't read it. A fine book for pressing flowers, a door stop, and a fly swatter. Theres is in no plot, no point, or any charactars, but I did like the type and the name of the publisher.",0
60,"Depressing!: I found this book super depressing and decidedly unromantic. Of course, I should have been warned with the word ""revenge"" in the book summary. For those of you who enjoy an uplifting, heart-warming, romantic story, avoid this book! This book is 390 pages long - less than 20 contain any happiness (in my opinion). I was disappointed, because it could have been a very sweet story ~ alas, it was not. If I hadn't bought it, I wouldn't even have finished it - however, I was determined to get my money's worth. Honestly, I would now pay to have this hauntingly sad, pointless tale out of my mind. I'm sure Lisa Klepas is a talented author - it is the story she choses to tell in ""Again the Magic"" that I object to.",0
61,"Good CD: I like Kenny. His songs are good, but the videos on CMT are very racy. This CD is the only one of his I own but I really enjoy it.",1
62,"Great CD as a Supplement to Oy Baby: I absolutely love the Oy Baby CD. Oy Baby 2 is also a very good CD, although not as good as the original, which is spectacular. I liked the variety of songs on Oy Baby 2 and the voices are beautiful. Most importantly, kids also enjoy them. Oy Baby 2 is a nice mix of songs sung by children and adults, music with and without words, and English and Hebrew songs. I have heard the CD mulitple times and am still not tired of it. I highly recommend buying it.",1
63,"great companion to Fountainhead: This book really helps a reader see ""the big picture"". I read it when I was about 60% of the way through the book when I grabbed the Cliff Notes. It's a good way to do it; I wouldn't have been able to grasp the overall concept of Fountainhead without it.",1
64,"Just barely fits the wide screen of an Elura 100: If you have a camera with a wide screen you may need to return this, but it just barely accommodates a Canon Elura 100. Other than that, this holds your external mike and lets you get a steadier shot. All for a few dollars.",1
65,"Great Comfy Rocker: This glider matches perfectly with the Cherry Wood crib and changing table. It is small enough to fit in a snug nursery, but big enough to be comfortable. It is virtually soundless as it glides and with the ottoman, it is a very cozy place to feed the baby and rock him to sleep. It is a great glider for the price especially!",1
66,"perfect: I am never traveling without this again. great for airports, for random hotels. works well with travel adapters, and the size is perfect.",1
67,"Although an old book still very useful: I was surprised to find in this book many of the things that appear in newer how-to knitting books eg the spiral sock that is on page 229, 230. And this not the only material that you will see that's in other books. In this book the material is in a rather condensed form. In the newer books it appears with color photographs and modernized. But still I find this a good book and especially at this price you can see where it all begun.",1
68,"IBOOM TRAVEL, NOT WORTH THE MONEY: I recently bought this unit. I was excited to try it, but I was very disappointed by the looks, it looks like a child's toy, the volume is distorted if played too loud or its not very loud at all if you lower it down. I followed the instructions, but apparently there is not much I can do, even if I play the unit at a different location to avoid interference. Overall, I am not pleased with the volume. It sounds terrible to include static. Not worth your money, find other altenatives for your IPOD.",0
69,"The Unfound Island: There was this boy, his name was Wil. He got up one morning and brushed his teeth like always. After brushing his teeth he went outside, grabbed his bike and went on a bike ride. He saw a deer in a near by field and he made a sudden movement, he went after it and lost it. Wil got back on to the dirt road. He ends up finding a pond. He found an old Johnson rowboat on the sore. He started rowing out toward the center of the pond. He found an island. That same day he went to the island, and he saw a loon, and her ducklings playing in the water.My likes and dislikes about the book The Island are, the book was good because it is an outdoors book. I chose this like, because I like being outdoors. A dislike about the book is that it was kind of boring for me I would recommend this book to people who would like to read a book about outdoors.",0
70,"Roshco Nonstick Broiler Pan: Do not buy this product. Not only did it warp the first time I used in, it was very difficult to clean. We used it to cook a London Broil. Both top and bottom warped and the meat almost fell off. After we ate, the pan settled back into its original shape but hard to clean. This is not good for a broiler pan and definitely not good for a non-stick product. Buyer beware!",0
71,Classic futuristic story: I love reading about our future and considering how close we are to actually picking the genetics of our children makes this book even that more engaging!,1
72,"GBA: I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the GBA. The graphics are outstanding, but there is still no backlight, which makes it difficult to see. I have a qorm light, but it's annoying and only lights the ceter of the screen. By not backlighting, Nintendo is increasing battery life, but I don't think that is nearly as important as game play.My other complaint is game selection. So far I have only played two games worth buying, although I own four. One is Tony Hawk Two, and the other is Mario Kart: Super Circuit. Both are outstanding games one can play for hours, and are the reasons of my four star rating. Other than these, however, there are very little.Overall, I would recommend this if you travel a lot or want something to play when not at home, but otherwise just buy a console. I recommend Xbox, but gamecube would be better for younger gamers, as are all nintendo products.",1
73,"Keeps me moving: I have used a wrist heart monitor in the past, that required me to push and hold two buttons while I was checking. There was no ongoing alarm so I often would slow down to check the rate only to find I was far below my top rate. I am an active 70 year old woman who wants to keep going as long as I can so I am training for a walking marathon. The Timex was ease. Just sent the ranges, put on the monitor and watch.. and go for it. I wear the watch all the time to help me with my time management via the chronometer and timer. Great price for lots of service.",1
74,Wonderful: I bought it used and it looks brand new. I was originally concerned the book wouldn't come before my exam but shipping was relatively fast and efficient. I would buy from this Amazon Seller again.,1
75,battery backup time: i needed a battery back up just in case if i am unable to plug in my wall charger. i tested this unit several times after fully charging the back up unit and it will charge my cell phone for 20 minutes and then it will run out of energy.the price dropped dramatically here on amazon so i am guessing it is being discontinued or it is on clearance.i am going to look for another back up unit,0
76,Great Multi-purpose product: I love this rice cooker/steamer. The non-stick surface makes clean-up a breeze. It is compact and efficient.,1
77,"Have to use jeweler: Others I bought had a clasp you could hook yourself. With these, you would need to get jeweler or someone to install. Not very user friendly. Keep looking.",0
78,"Quality of the book: This is not a review of the HG Wells stories which are obviously 2 of the finest works of Science Fiction ever. This is a review regarding the quality of the book itself. I bought this combo-book for my son to introduce him to the works of HG Wells, however he could barely get past the first few pages because the print is so small it is impossible to read. The clarity of the printing and the sharpness of each letter of each word is horrible. The words are blurry, the letters are at times indistinguishable from each other. By all means read the Wells books, but I suggest not trying to save a couple of dollars by buying this version. Search for a better quality book.",0
79,"Do not buy - breaks first day: This thing broke the first day. After testing it once, taking it out, putting it back in, and playing again, it only plays on half the speakers in my japanese car. It's only 9 bucks, so not really worth returning. It's crap.",0
80,"Yep, it's really greasy: I read the reviews about this product here and elsewhere on Amazon and noted how some said it left their faces greasy. But since my skin was so dry and it was the dark of winter, I was sure it wouldn't be too much. Yep, it's greasy alright. And it makes my late 40s face break out. Nothing like having an adolescent sheen of grease and two huge zits on your chin to look younger. But that wasn't what I was hoping for when I wanted a product to restore youthfulness! I've used Dermalogica, Cellex-C, Obagi and other leading cosmetic lines, but Murad products definitely lead the way in leaving your face slightly waxy. I have the night products kit, too, with the cleanser, toner, age-diffusing serum, and night cream and I wake up with a sheen, too. But I can deal with it at night.",0

82,"Real Deal Fun: It plays like real table tennis and has realistic everything about it. Ball action is just as you'd expect from a real game of table tennis. Love the characteristics of each individual player, the different venues are cool and how the players react and sweat etc. Definitely recommend this one for the whole family, something you can't do for alot of games.",1
83,"Get the 'Hook Up': This new CD from the Mighty Clouds of Joy is a joyful album that is welcome in these times. The first track, ""Hook Up"", sets the tone of most of the album with punchy horns and swirling organ. ""I Want to Thank You"" and ""Jesus Made a Way"" are more jubilant songs of praise. The Mighty Clouds bring the tempo down on ""God Can"" and ""He Didn't Bring Me This Far"", which are beautiful in a traditional style. A few tracks like ""Seeking the Fire"" have contemporary R&B beats, keyboards, and backing vocals. The mix of traditional gospel and modern R&B sounds on this record keep the music interesting, and the lyrics are always uplifting. ""Right Here Waiting"", a duet with Dottie Peoples, and ""He Didn't Bring Me This Far"" are the most comforting songs to me, and will keep you going in trying times.",1

86,"A legendary man, but a trivial book: Without a doubt one of the most poorly written books that I have every read. The author normally writes newspaper articles and it's obvious. Each chapter is written like a short article off the main page which results in a shallow read. There is no transition between chapters and much of the information in one chapter is repeated in subsequent chapters. It takes talent to make such a fascinating life such an incredible bore.",0

I can't imagine that it would even defrost a windshield any faster than the car's defroster. Very upsetting because there isn't another portable dryer on the market. The only other thing available is a rechargeable hair dryer that costs about $179.00. I gave it one star because it would not let me rate it with nothing.",0

91,"Repuslive and elegant: It is hard to avoid acknowledging the intelligence behind this work but it is equally hard to understand the point. The author dislikes his characters and his city, focusing on ugliness, squalor, stench, and scat. There is a lot of shocking and unpleasant material often told in a highly imaginative and creative fashion. The writing is erudite, complex, and sophisticated but also full of hatred for the characters. I could not find any psychological realism or meaningful plots but did find vivid, pungent, toilet imagery.",0

93,"Still waiting for an ""Collector's Edition"": This is C&C's funniest film ever. ""Up In Smoke"" is really good and establishes the duo's place in the cinema, but 'Next Movie' is just plain awesome.I was planning to buy this dvd, and still intend to do so, but was a little disappointed that they did not include any footage of the deleted or alternate scenes. Those of you who saw the 'diamonds version' on comedy central years ago know what I mean. There were some extra or extended made-for-tv scenes that really filled the movie out nicely...not like this is an epic picture like Gone With The Wind, War and Peace or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Still in all, this one is a purchase.",1
94,"Not quite the book, but still good...: Yeah well, for those of you, like me, who read the book, there's not much to add. This is NOT as good, as epic, as mind-twisting as Anne Rice's novel.But still, past this obvious and expected dissappointment, I still believe it's quite entertaining, and better than Interview. On another note, the soundtrack really kicks ...and very much in line with the scenes I had pictured when reading the book.Nothing about the twins, nothing about Pandora and nothing about quite a few other characters. But again, take this movie for what it is: a fair adaptation of an incredible book.Oh, and even though I've never been a fan of Aaliyah's music, I must admit she could have been a promising young actress... a shame really...",1
95,"Great for young dino lovers: We got this CD for Christmas and our children (ages 3 & 4) absolutely love it. We knew our son would, he loves all things dinosaur, but even our daughter begs to listen to this, and she is not a dino fan. The songs are catchy, the tunes make the words easy to remember, it is educational. To me, the CD seemed a bit annoying to listen to at first, and I actually like Disney music. But after listening to it several dozen times in the last few weeks, it is starting to grow on me. It does not fade into the background like some other children's music so we have to limit how many times we play it in a row or it could drive us crazy. But overall- this is a great CD to give to any dino lover, they will love it.",1
96,"A Must for Pumping Moms: These bottles are great and super easy to use and clean. My one grip is that they're somewhat costly, especially considering that I store 10oz of milk a day, which equates to 4 bottles (each bottle is 2.5oz). If I didn't also use the plastic Medela freezer bags, I'd have to purchase a box every three days.",1

98,"A great re-introduction to the world of comics: I have been ""off"" comic books for well over two decades. I was passing by the magazine rack in my local grocery when I saw this collection on the bottom rack. I purchased it on impulse, and found when I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down.... What probably had prevented me from picking up a comic is the tremendous back-story that exists. Many times, the reader will need to have ""kept up"" with past issues to gain a full understanding and a sense of all the nuances contained in a modern comic. ""Ultimate Spiderman"" lifts this burden by discarding the ""past"" and starting fresh, re-telling the Spiderman legend beginning in the present day. This is incredible for attracting a new generation of fans, but it's also great for we old-timers who have been away for a while. I highly recommend this collection to both new and old comic fans.",1
99,Shes talented and beautiful: Shania Twain is a beautiful and talented women who believes in herself and her ability. This DVD shows us all just how talented a women she is. The songs are great ones from the past and absolute blow outs for new songs. You add that with the beauty she has and her caring for her fans and you have the best female singer there is. This DVD is great and one for the books and your DVD collection.,1

I bought this version which promises internet play. Trying to make it work across AOL and other service providers has been very difficult. Playing through Zone.com requires you to accept an unacceptable privacy policy. I've given up on internet play with it. The game can be annoying because unlike the original Hasbro version, you have fewer options in play such as when you are challenged and the tile shuffle has a weird grab and switch letter feature.

110,"who is this for??: I'm not sure yet where this book lies in the spectrum of Flash books out there. This book seems to be targetted at the somewhat intermediate or experienced Flash user - which is where I am with Flash. But doesn't hit that mark. It doesn't tell you much about RIAs, actionscript, or Flash 2004, the things an experienced user wants to learn. It certainly doesn't cover anything to interest the intermediate to advanced Flash user, all of whom could probably circle the author in knowledge (or at least what this book leads you to believe). Yet it isn't for the beginner either, who would have no use for this book either.So I've really come to the conclusion this book isn't for most, which is where the rating comes from (that, and some mistakes/holes). Overall, I just see this book as a weak offering overall. I think it was just to rush a title on the market before the other books out there.",0

112,"Smooth Jazz Killed the Yellowjackets: To call this disk ""The Best of the Yellowjackets"" is a joke. Absent are the great early tunes like the title track from Greenhouse; in fact, there are NO tunes on this CD from Greenhouse, The Spin, or Four Corners. What the heck happened to this band, with their interesting phrasing and intricate compositions? What happened to the great sax? WHAT HAPPENED?! Thank God I have their earlier work on cassette. I cannot even find the CDs now. They must be out of print. At any rate, do NOT waste your money on this CD. I just bought the disk today and it is bound for the nearest used record store as soon as I have time to unload it. This band totally sold out to so-called smooth jazz (a misnomer for yuppie elevator muzak) and it simply is not worth the money. How sad. At this point, my only hope is that they've disbanded. The last thing we need is another smooth jazz group. Yellowjackets, R.I.P.",0

I got together with a friend who was a ""struggling"" actor way back when and we bought standing only tickets. I think they were about 10 bucks at the time and that was all we could afford. The show was amazing. When Jennifer Holiday started signing ""And I am telling you I'm not going"", everyone in the theatre stood up and started applauding. It was so electrifying that to this day I still get goosebumps and teary eyed when I think of that night. The amazing way the producers thought to end the first act by the curtain just coming down during her song, was spectacular.

The only problem is like Inside Out, the tracks tend to blur a bit and sound the same. HOwever, Illusions, Wave Goodbye, and Free Step are all distinctly awesome.

The book can be divided into three parts; the history and impact of smallpox on the human race, the unprecidented efforts to successfully eradicate this disease from the earth, and its real potential for reintroduction as a potent bioweapon.

Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning.

Their roots are in 50's doo wop but thier hits came later in the mid sixties. They were a AM radio friendly top 40 group but what makes them relevant is that they sang about harder edge themes and not puppy love. Imagine the Beachboys singing the Animals', ""We Got To Get Out of This Place"", and you get a rough idea. As the years move on, they seem to stray from what made them popular because the later songs are covers of 50's doo wop (Earth Angel..ect.) always flawlessly delivered but they adding nothing to the originals, that's why I dropped a star. Still, they made strong music, ""Five O'Clock World"" is a powerfull observation about the human condition and as good or better than anything Bruce Springteen ever wrote.",1

163,"One little problem.: I am very happy with this camera,that I received last week, but there is one little problem that I ran into. It really eats up the battery life if using regular Alkaline batteries. The manual doesn't state this but I found out when speaking with customer support that one should really use rechargeable batteries. I am now in the process of seeing how long these will last. If one reads the manual you would think you could get over 200 pictures or so with a set of the Alkalines. I put in fresh batteries the day I received the camera and was on a second set the next day. Apparently the drainage was caused by keeping the camera on while exploring the various features and taking test photos. Otherwise, it takes great pictures and has lots of good camera features.",1

166,"Doesn't Do Justice to the Book: This movie doesn't come close to doing justice to Alice Sebold's extraordinary book. While it has a lot of lovely special effects, the gist of the story falls flat; the excitement is gone.The story is about a young girl who is murdered by a serial killer. Her family is torn apart by the ordeal and each of them, in their own way, can't get over the murder. The murdered girl watches over her family from a semi-heaven as she, too, can't fully let go of her life. The actors in the movie (Mike Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci) are usually top-notch. However, in this film, their performances are rote. The only performance that stands out is Stanley Tucci's as the creepy murderer.I recommend you see this on DVD or skip it altogether. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's astonishingly beautiful.",0

176,"great cable, but heed the directionality warning: First of all, this cable works great, AS LONG AS YOU CONNECT IT PROPERLY. The vibration damping alloys increased efficiency of my system by 15%. In fact, the flux capacitor now kicks in at just over 76 mph! Unfortunately, that's where my good fortunes ended. It turns out, since the directionality is NOT clearly marked, I actually had it connected backwards the first time. Not only did I end up shifting the entire universe in time instead of myself, but I had to spend 3 hours explaining myself to the department of Temporal Investigations. And believe me, those guys have no sense of humor. At any rate, I was eventually able to repair most of the damage, and as it turns out, causality is not nearly as important as most people would think.Anyway, I highly recommend this product, but do make sure you connect it properly.

She gets rammed on a snowy road, meets a bad guy alone at night, follows another one and rescues him from drowning when he wrecks his car, gets shot at, buried in snow, etc. Even after each of these things happens to her, she does the next dumb thing. She has a cop/friend, goes off to a dance with him without even telling him about her horrendous adventure of that day. Her dog is the best thing in her life, mostly because he's smarter than she is.

Neill's only release seems to be Vince, a druggie character who lives on the edge. These trysts seem to be his only relief in his world, which is chaos.Eventually, Neill has to make a choice to allow his definition of himself to be known to all, regardless of the outcome. The fact that one can take the high road (which is hard) or the low road, which is the easy way out, is at the crux of this touching, interesting book.",1

Within minutes my child figured out how to get it off his head and pretty much did so every time I put it on. Sometimes the ring would remain around his head (or neck!) sometimes he'd pull the whole thing off. Within a month all the parts were falling apart. The velcro doesn't stay stuck. The adjustment doesn't really work on the smallest setting, and the fabric came unglued. I bought a differrent helmet, since this one seemed useless and I want one that will stay on his head, expecially if we advance to a seat not just the trailer. I would not recommend it to anyone.",0

Each brother in the Carsington family of course has to be a bit different. I was kind of surprised we went from the third brother to the first brother in the series but not at all dismayed. I loved the plot and the setting. The characters were really fun. Bathsheba is quite a character tho' trying not to live up to the family name. The ending is quite funny. That scheming Lord Hargate is turning out to be quite the guy. The scheming daughter and the precocious nephew are quite the team. I loved how this played out and the care and concern you can see between the uncle and nephew. (I ignore the sexual parts. Thankfully not overly graphic but a number of them in each novel.),1

The songs None of your friends business I like that alot because it's not none of your friends business what you and your boyfriend or girlfriend do. I like So Anxious alot to because you find many ladies and gentleman that are anxious to do things they shouldn't be doing. Wait A Mintue is another song that I like alot because girls and boys most of the time always believe what somebody else say and don't even give their boyfriend or girlfriend time to explain because of what somebody done told them. 100% Ginuwine is really for your mind because it tells you about your society and the way you are if you really listen to it because everybody tell their friends things and believe what their friends say.

The pocket is located between your back and all of the picnic stuff, so your actually squeezing your food any time you wear it.And worst of all, the straps are the worst design I have ever worn. The design of the attachment of the top of the straps to the bag is so backwards it actually hurts to carry it with any weight.

The guy offers to drive him to the college and Clark finally agrees after some time.

A while after he sees that same guy walking down the street and he chases,catches,and tells him to give his stuff back. The guy didn't have his money but MOST of his clothing. The guy told Clark that he could give him a job paying $500 a trip. That's where Clark gets himself into trouble,not realizing what he was doing. This is a funny and cute movie.

233,"Worth a look mostly because of the author: It was Iceberg's last novel; apparently published posthumously. Seems to me to be in an extremely unfinished state; the dialogue is bizarre. Not bizarre in the ""ebonics"" manner that ""Pimp"" was in, but dialogue the likes of which nobody really speaks in. I can't tell if he wrote it out in what he considered educated english (in a way it is just that), or his idea was to write the story as a sketch wherin the protagonists have really pronounced argots; later changing it to be more realistic.While his classic ""Pimp"" wasn't exactly what you'd call a cheerful book, this one was positively bleak in its misanthropic outlook. As a novel, it is a complete failure, but the depths he plumbs in this one (exploring his misogyny via what is apparently the story of his childhood), and the fact that it is Iceberg Slim's work, make it worth a look.",0
234,"Good workout, but not great for an apartment: This video is physically difficult. I am runner and decided to switch up my workout routine. I have had a hard time getting through the first three songs. The steps take a little while to learn (there is an instructional part first), but it is very difficult to do this dvd unless you have A LOT of room to move around. I live in NYC apartment and even after moving some of my furniture out of my living (which is a decent size), I still find it hard to move adequately enough to do this workout without getting frustrated. It is a great workout if you have the patience to learn the dance moves first and have enough space. I have the mat workout as well and that requires far less space to perform those moves. I have not made any other changes to my exercise routine or diet and people have asked me what I've been doing because I look better. Tracy Anderson knows what she's doing.",1

My only regret was that I didn't think to pack more books by this fun writer to take along on my vacation as well.After I got home I huried on the net and ordered Ms. Murray's four-book Lambert series and couldn't wait to read them. BOY OH BOY...What a fun set of books they were. Now, I am anxious to get my hands on more of this writer's books! She is a terrific writer who sure knows how to show her readers a fun, fun time!

Steven Samuel has just got to do another book at this level of intensity. I'll be first in line.",1

I couldn't agree more:""Authors Garlow and Jones seem a bit reactive as they attempt to set straight the historical record against the ""smear campaign"" by Brown's novel. Brown, they say, uses ""venomous language"" when he accuses the early church of being misogynistic. This dumbed-down tome states things too simply. The authors beat readers over the head by including fear tactics - cheesy fictional vignettes of ""Carrie,"" a modern-day coed who struggles after reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" and is nearly swayed by her lesbian roommate, but eventually sees the light. There is some good historical background, but it's hard to get past the authors' exclamatory tone.""I am waiting to get The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code by Abanes. Shorter Cheaper.

246,"Civilization at it's finest: This is my favorite in the series of Civilization games. A huge improvement in graphics over the first and second game, this game also lacks the clunkyness I found to be detracting from the fourth game. The one downside of this game is that even when put into a sort of slow mode, you inevitably end up rushing through the games earlier units to try to get the best military in the world. The fix for this are the scenarios which lock in certain time periods and goals to help mix up gameplay a bit. With the addition of two expansion packs, new nations and special units become available, making this game a must have for those who wish to conquer the world!",1
247,"Buy it NOW! $125 is a STEAL for this amazing game.: If you don't buy this game now, you are a crackhead. This is easily the best RPG ever to grace any videogame system. This game FAR surpasses anything even today. The only complaints I would have with this game are the result of future suikodens giving fans what they asked for. Namely jeane as a playable character, more of her boobs and less clothing. Mcdhol makes an appearance in this as you can load the save game from the first suikoden- a very original idea. Much of what needs to be said has been said by others. If you don't add this game to your collection you belong in a psyciantric hospital.",1

(which Homer later repeated in 'The Principal and the Pauper')Bart the Murderer was another clever concoction. The explanation given as to Skinner's disappearance was so unlikely it was comical, and the representation of the seedy world of Gangland businesmen was satirical and clever.

I had just about given up when a friend recommended this to me.It does have some of that excess ""stuff"" that King writes, but for the most part, it is a highly engaging, richly rewarding, heartfelt story which did not fail to keep my interest. I won't review the plot since the Amazon review and many other reviewee's will give you trailer. I will only mention that the characters are filled out and believable, the plot is entertaining and suspenseful, and the overall book rocks just a little. Don't let the author's name fool you. If you've tried Stephen King and found him wanting, try this book. Both it, and it's sequel are well worth the read.",1

261,Was finished before I started!: Unbelievably short game. Seems like EA simply wanted to pump out a follow-up to the hugely successful Frontline before people forgot about it (and in time for Christmas). Takes about 1/4 the time to complete as its predecessor. I just couldn't believe that I'd reached the end of this game within the first couple days of purchasing it.

265,"Don't waste your time.: I ordered this to replace a Plantronics headset. I returned them because they are uncomfortable and the volume/mute switch is very hard to use.The fit is very tight, with very little padding on the ear or over the top of your head; if you are a 'conehead' these might actually work for you, though. :) I adjusted these to the shortest they could be but the speakers still sat below the bottom of my ears, and I'm no tiny person.Combining the mute and volume control is a great idea, but the switch rarely worked properly. You push the button squarely in the center to mute, push up/down to in/decrease volume. Every time I tried adjusting the volume, I would mute the microphone, and vice versa. Perhaps my set was defective but taking 5-6 'pushes' on the +/- side of the switch to adjust the volume up/down 1 notch is unacceptable.The best thing about this headset is the USB PnP ability.I'd suggest you avoid these and purchase the Plantronics DS-500 for about $10 more, instead.",0

One side has Baby Einstein pictures and a story, and the other side has real photos of planets and other things in the sky and universe. My daughter already had the Baby Neptune - Oceans book similar to this and liked that one much better, the pictures were more colorful and there was more to look at. She hasn't seemed too interested in this one though. I don't think there's enough pictures and interesting things to look at in this book. She's already 2 so maybe it's a better book for a 1-yr old.",1
267,"Highly seductive: A friend passed this book to me and I was excited to read something by a new author. I really liked this book. The island of Cyrene adds an interesting new touch to the typically London based regency romance novel. I am eager to read more from Ms. Jordan and the others in this series.The plot is fairly typical or regency romance. She agrees to pose as his fiance to get his family off his back and help him find his friend's killer. The interesting twists in this novel include: the immediate sensuality (I feel like more and more often we are waiting until page 200 for more than a kiss), Diana's artistic talent seems more thought out than other characters I have read in the past who mearly like to paint, and his interesting ties with the Guardians (a secret group of men who work together for the good of humanity).

The battery has good charging time and goes for a good few hours without needing a recharge. Perfect also for the long car trips in which i play Red Alert 2. So overall, I give it a 9/10.

It only took me a day to complete the book.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars were the typos. A very horrible job was done on the editing.

There are only 2 compositions of Coltrane in the album.....plus ""My Favorite Things"", arguably, the definitive recording by Coltrane (1963).Other than that , the music is great with the other 7 tracks composed by Bob Mintzer in a Coltrane mode. The whole affair comes off really well with a lot of fine solo work...a good part of it Mintzer's.The only glitch, for me, was a rather bizarre intro to ""A Love Supreme - Acknowledgement"" which I didn't care for.Otherwise a good mixture of some slower moody compositions and some medium tempo movers.....all excellent arrangements and good solos from the likes of Randy Brecker, Michael Mossman and Pete Yellin.Very good orchestration on ""Impressions"" and two other selections ""Softly Spoken"" (just that!) and ""Spirits"", one of the moodier pieces.All in all, I'm very happy with this cd and look forward to playing it often.",1

Unfortunately, I looked and looked in this book, and just saw more of the same.The premise is somewhat unique, the 'suffering is everywhere, trying to avoid it makes you crazy, i.e. neurotic' basis of the book.You can sum this book up in the famous quote, which I will ruin here, 'Life is a struggle, the sooner you realize that the better off you'll be'There is a section on goal-setting? Meditation? Very run-of-the-mill stuff for modern self-help literature.I really wanted to like this book, but it is a long walk for a brief and simple premise.

Crossed checked with brachial monitor and the Mark of Fitness wrist cuff gave readings for the same person of elevated pressures, i.e. 160/100, to pressures that were normal. Several re-checks were performed to substantiate findings.",0

303,"Barely coconut flavored: I really wish that the ingredients had been posted. Here they are for the rest of you: Water, Organic Alcohol, Organic Agave Syrup, Organic Coconut Milk. This very, very faintly smells of coconut, and kind of, almost, tastes like it. Not sure why an extract, particularly one as sweet as coconut, needs a sugar in it? As heat typically decreases the intensity of flavor(s), I can't imagine this ""Extract"" imparting much coconut flavor into baked goods. I will try it in ice cream and frosting and update this review at that time. I am thinking that, in order to get a super-duper coconutty flavor, I am going to have to just take the time and reduce some pure coconut milk. Or, maybe I'll try juicing a fresh coconut. Has anyone else tried this before? Results? I am open to suggestions.",0
304,"Was this a joke ?: I had heard about the GREAT KAT for years but never really paid much attention.Had a chance to see this DVD.IS THIS A JOKE ?Irritating noise, no real guitar playing to speak of and what is there is monotonous diatonic noodling with a buzzy tone.There is no semblance of music to be seen or heard here, just an attempt to be as controversial and noisy as possible.Beyond bad.",0
305,"Not great.: Why George would want to give away royalties by recording other people is a mystery to me. His music is to extraordinary that I really do prefer to hear his original compositions. I have always hated Randy Newman and do not want to hear his music, even if it's been ""Winstonized"". Not bad but not great. George's own pieces on this cd are terrific but there aren't enough of them.",0
306,"A Must Read For Any MJ Fan: This is Michael in his own words. I couldn't put it down. If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also "" The Magic and the Madness "" By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian. But most people forger that and want to focus only on the negative and what the media says. Michael was one of the greatest entertainers of music history and there will never be another like him.",1

312,"This book is decieving like Gary Zukov.: He tells that the astral world is made up of your thoughts and fantasies and the higher realms are made up of humans elavated thoughts about heaven.Thus,implicated the thought in your head that your astral travels are ILLUSORY.In fact they are of seperate creation and is an insult to fearies/nature spirits/angels/God by saying they are not real.This book is bad.This goldberg man reduces the spiritual art to nothing but a form of childrens dream.This book won't help you to leave your body either,it has methods that he expects you to simply master.Also he does not tell how to find you guides or friends but tells you instead when you do find them.I would have refund this book if I didn't leave in my salon floor for a month.",0
313,"Great book for starters: If you are decided to pay attention seriously to your nutrition and its side effects, this book is perfect.

314,"Other Books by the Author Are Better: There is nothing wrong with this book or it's content. It is a book about subconcious mind control, through affirmation and visualisation.So why did I give it 2 Stars? Very simple, the reader would be better off buyingYOUR INFINITE POWER TO BE RICH, by J. MurphyAll the content in this book is covered in greater detail in the aforementioned book. I hate books that are produced as an off shoot from another book. I always feel as if the reader is being conned by the publishers, to increase their revenues.If you would like a full review of the content of this book, go to the review I gave for, Your Infinite Power To Be Rich.The concept is the same, but this time the book is too short to fully appreciate the analytical concept.My Advice is forget this mini book and buy Your Infinite Power To Be Rich.",0
315,"Worthless: It really amazes me that some folks thought so much of this film. I work on a film festival committee and we turned this film down for showing. It was predictable, not especially well acted or well written. I really can't think of much of anything to recommend it other then a bit of titillating sex.",0
316,"If you're a Subs fan you should buy this.: I had ignored this compilation for years because I assumed it was just another dodgy compilation. But guess again...this CD features a whole bunch of obscure demo's that you won't find anywhere else. Some of these have been previously released - most notably on the Demonstration Tapes record which came out in the mid 80's (which itself was a reissue of sorts).Even more annoying, the sleeve notes make no mention of the fact that these are alternate takes/ demos etc.. So if you're a Subs fan you should find this release interesting and enjoyable. I certainly recommend it.",1
317,"Bad ""Less Than Zero"" outtakes: Obviously written before Ellis' first book, LESS THAN ZERO, these stories have little depth or structure. They're mostly character sketches, and very rough ones at that. One of the worst stories involves a vampire that goes to see a psychiatrist (yes, really), with an ending lifted right from Stephen King's ""The Boogeyman"". Stick to Ellis' novels instead.",0
318,"Disapointing: The product arrived dented, I think we returned it twice and finally just settled for what we received. There is no lid that fits this thing...making some tasks impossible. The handle looks like its of poor quality, I really expected more of revere ware",0
319,"3.5 Stars, decent album with hot singles: Vintage review, I am bored at work again. Finally got around to my CD case and pulled this album out. This album has one constant theme: ""Playa Playa"". The singles were hot for the album ""How You Want That"" and Down For Me"". I wish they release Like A Movie with Claudette Ortiz as a single. This could had sold more and had a better rating, but they are too many cons than pros.Top 3 Songs: How You Want That, Like A Movie, Down for MeBottom 3 Songs: Do What You Like, Friday Night, Hey WooSleeper: Relax Your Mind",1

321,"Sleeves will ruin discs: DO NOT USE THESE SLEEVES for any extended period of time. As documented by others the chemicals from the plastic sleeve will leach unto your disks and make them incredibly difficult to clean without damaging and will very likely ruin many of them.It is unbelievable that Memorex is still acting like they have never heard of this problem since there is clear documentation here that the problem dates back to at least 2007. They should have developed an easy chemical cleaning solution by now.I can't believe that Memorex is still selling these sleeves, which are known to be faulty.",0

323,"Amazing show...Terrible Ending: Gilmore Girls is the best TV series ever created! My single mom and I would sit down weekly and watch this show ever since it started and surprisingly I was the same age as Rory. It truly mirrored our relationship. I will miss it greatly! Season 7 was better than I expected after reading reviews of it, but the last 2 episodes were horrific. My mom and I both agreed that Rory should have married Logan, and that there should have definitely been more of a reunion between Loralei and Luke. Also, the ending should have been an episode with a look into the future so you know what really happens to the characters in the end! I pray that there is a movie made to wrap up these lose ends and even reunite Rory and Logan! Everyone should watch and own the whole series!",1
324,Boring: Are you kidding me. This game is horrible. Hard to control. The camera angles are just to hard to control.I rented it and played it about 45 minutes before I put in a new game. It would totally suck if I had bought it.,0
325,"Worst tool I have bought so far.: I bought this tool based on looks and thinking the hefty price would mean a quality tool. The Bostitch web site says ""Jam Free Design"". This thing CONSTANTLY jams! Very frustrating when you are on a ladder trying to attach felt paper or insulation. You cna clear the jam (remove all staples and pry out jamed staples) then put in new staples and maybe shoot 5 or 10 staples before it jams again.",0
326,Entertaining and Educational!: My 18 month old loves Little Bill. The shows and the books intrigue him and hold his attention. He loves identifying the characters in the books and listening to me read to him. I highly recommend the entire series.,1

328,"Just one complaint.: This is just about all the Chrome you'll need if you're a first time listener, plus it's a great alternative than trying to track down the individual albums on CD, nearly all of which are out of print, however, as many of the other reviews have stated, there is a lot missing. True, I can live without many of the instrumental songs that got the boot, but the missing five studio tracks from ""Blood on the Moon"" are sorely missed.True, you get four of them as live version, but the quality is rather muddy and makes me wonder why they couldn't just put the studio versions instead. In fact, if they got rid of the live songs, they could have fit ""Blood on the Moon"" in it's entirety.Besides that one gripe, it's a great box set for beginners and collectors alike.",1
329,"Awe Inspiring: I came to this album with no knowledge of who Red House Painters or Mark Kozolek were. This is the first material I heard from the group. Since, its become one of my favorite albums of all time.This is the best album of 2003, hands down. It took me until the end of 2004 to stop listening to it on a weekly basis, and was my favorite album of 2004 as well.",1

331,"Nothing like picture- crap: Extremely not happy with this! I purchased this because I really liked the simplicity of the look. It looked nothing like the picture. It came with various crappy things glued to it- a house, a kid and a bird all proportionally out of whack. The bird is the same size as the kid and the house is half the size of both. The picture shows water in the pond. When I filled it with water it leaked out everywhere; when I inquired about it- the response was fill it with pretty pebbles. I was so annoyed with that.",0
332,"Strapping in the child feature is extremely inconvenient and impractical - BEWARE!: We recently bought this car seat without knowing that Graco car seats actually have 2 different kinds of methods of tightening the baby seat belt in the car seat. We found that this particular colour that we bought Tango, you had to place the child in the seat, tilt the car seat forward, all the while making sure to hold the child in the seat so that he does not fall out, tighten the belt from the back of the car seat before the belt is tight enough to be used. There is the other type of car seat where there is a strap at the bottom where you can simply just pull to tighten. I do not know why Graco is still circulating car seats that has the extremely impractical and inconvenient model. In the end we returned this seat to Amazon, and went to Babies R US to view the right model and bought from there. We ended up paying a cheaper price as well.",0
333,"Title is more interesting than the book: I liked the title, but I'm having a hard time finding interest in the book..The book is all about defining the word ""crone"" as just a wise, fun,etc. older women...

335,"A disappointing effort: I find it very hard for me to not recommend this book, but I am starting to find these stories repetitive. The ending to this book is too pat and seemed to be a let down after all the build up. Ms. Hamilton's stereotypes of law enforcement have gotten old and tired and she never seems to change. It's time for her to break out of the tried and true pattern she's been using for these books and step out in a new direction. Hopefully future installments of the Anita Blake series will break new ground.",0
336,"Doing less with more...: The good part about this book is at least you get a historical reference, timeline and summary of major press releases. This book is poorly written and lacks any opinion, insight or true understanding of the issues facing the telecom industry. But at least is was first to market.",0
337,"hideously ridiculous: ....but,but jolie is in it !!!! shes hot so the movie has to be great. right ?!?!?!?this might have been an alright waste of time in the vain of RED, The Expendables, From Paris With Love and any jason statham movie if it hadnt taken itself seriously. its highly unbelievable, poorly acted, had zero humor (implied or intended), those behind the scenes didnt fair any better.from what i remember;shes a spy, but isnt on the side she thinks she on or should be on. this takes the premise from ''last kiss goodbye'' a little further. the action sequences were lame, there was no tension or intruige. the plot, again, was laughable. if this didnt have jolie in it, it would not be getting attention or ratings above 2 stars.easily forgettable.",0
338,"Excellent overview of Marion Art: This DVD is very well put together. The icons and other artwork are well displayed. There is a sense of ""how did they do that?"" on many items. The Pieta in St. Peters is seen behind the glass,etc. Well presented by Jane Seymore.",1
339,"Don't waste your time: Arrrrrrrrrgh. That's all I have to say about this latest installment of Ms. Gabaldon. I have read the previous novels and thoroughly enjoyed them...in fact, I've read them each twice, but this one; I just couldn't make it. So boring and seemed to go nowhere for the longests time. I was so disappointed, I resold the book. I do hope if she writes additional installments to the Jaimie/Clair adventures, that she returns to the format of the previous ones...this was awful.",0

341,"Come on!!!: I love this movie that's why I gave it 5 stars but my VHS copy got trashed and I wanted to replace it with a DVD copy, but I can't even do that because I'm not paying $30 for a used copy and I'm definitely not paying $70 for a new! Just because Haim is dead it does not give people the right to jack up the price for one of his movie that you used to be able to buy for a normal price! I'm upset this is ridiculous!!!!!!!",1

345,"Good rock music: This is what i call rock music good beat and good lyrics, don't listen to the other reviews. This cd is one of the best, listen to a few songs and you will get hooked. I recommend this cd its awesome.",1
346,"If you seriously consider yourself a dummy...: then by all means pick this book up. However, if you know the basics then this book is all review. If you are serious about body building then the coventional training methods in this book are not going to make you Steve Austin overnight or even 3 years as they are becoming out dated. That is unless you take steroids. But new programs are being made and are more effective than the conventional exercises in this book. But for the beginning dummy, this book is just right.",1
347,Fantastic Book: This is an awesome book. There is a related video that makes many of the exercises even more clear.I have found that combining many of these exercises with the overall program listed in The Complete Guide to Navy SEAL Fitness by Stewart Smith is a winning combination. Mr. Tsatsouline's exercises are more efficient and when worked into the overall program in Mr. Smiths book produce great results.,1
348,"EWJ 3D Rocks!: Though most people disliked this game, I thought it was very fun and cool. I am a HUGE Earthworm Jim fan and I didn't think this game was disapointing at all. The idea is that Jim has ben knocked out by a bug falling cow and now he has to fight the villians of his tiny (almost useless) mind and regain consciousness. This came could have been better, but I still highly recommend it! Earthworm Jim 3D is a great, fun and challenging game.",1

352,"Dont waste your time with this one!: After reading all the reviews for this book, I was really excited to read it. Boy, was I disappointed! This is a stupid book full of insipid, fully unlikeable characters. There was no one even remotely appealing. And I did not understand this great ""love"" between March and Hollis, as it did not seem to be anything except lust, even from the beginning. If you still must read this book, get it from the library. That way you still may lose several hours of your life reading it, but at least you wont waste any money. Just make sure you return it on time as it is not worth the 5 cents a day overdue fees.",0
353,"Dissapointing: After loving monkey ball one me and my girlfriend decided to pick up monkey ball 2, hoping for the same addicting gameplay on such party games as monkey target and monkey bowling, but with a few more stages and such. What we got was a game that somehow totally ruined the franchise. Monkey target all of a sudden requires no skill, they basically throw points at you, and 2 players going at once? Sounds good but it just makes the huge stages harder to see. Monkey bowlings still god though right? No! All of the monkeys now bowl drastically differently, meaning that if you liked gongon in monkey ball one, you now will have to pick a totally different character to bowl like you want to. Oh and the one player story mode.... let me just barf now. Amazingly kiddy ish, it might as well have been designed by 2 years olds who like bright colors and the word poo. Pick up monkey ball one and leave this sad try at a sequal in the bargain bin.",0
354,"Unbreakable, until broken.: This press functioned well when operated. I brought it to a class to serve classmates and it received much praise. There was no off-taste from the plastic and the grounds stayed firmly in place and not in my mouth. After a couple washes, the story changed.

Soon after, the mesh component of the actual press mechanism fell off.I wouldn't recommend it.",0

But, wanting to make sure that I had the code framed correctly I had to read this book first - the prequel.All I can say is that this is a silly little - although 500+ pages - book. It is not Trevanian, Follett, nor even Clancy at his worst. It is barely a book for a long airplane flight nor a bout with allergies. Why did I read the whole thing? Why do we watch baseball????",0

359,Not worth the price increase.: I purchased these several months back and paid only $5.50 and am now shocked to see the price has jumped to over $14.00. These are nice covers but not worth the new price tag. I will look for a different style as a replacement.,0

They are so endearing. The lyrics are all wonderful. This is one of my favorite albums.",1
361,"Two Green Thumbs Up!: Greenlit is a documentary that opens your mind about waste and the film industry. Being one of the biggest moneymakers in the world, it also produces tons of waste. One might not realize the impact the film industry has on the public but it is absolutely enormous. It puts a lot in perspective seeing that watching films and television shows is something almost everyone does everyday. Greenlit is a funny and touching film that introduces the concept of the film industry going green. Miranda Bailey, the film's director, takes us on her journey to attempt making the film The River Why green. Bailey's voiceover is not only funny but also poignant. As the film goes on everyone realizes the it isn't easy being green, but if everyone just takes small steps it can make a big difference. This documentary is something everyone should see. It puts a lot of things in perspective. Greenlit is short, sweet, and to the point.",1
362,"Fast, tight read, a quick dive to the earth's depths: The plot is fast, tight, and doesn't waste time bringing you down into the earth's bowels. Its subject matter - caves and the 'creatures' that 'dwell within' - is fairly new, and quite absorbing. The structure of the story is reminiscent of Jurassic Park / Micheal Crichton.However, as an amateur spelunker, I found the treatment on the scientific basis of the story very light. Mr. Rollins could have elaborated more on the development of caves, the different rock formations, etc. to add ""meat"" to his novel. I was hoping to find more descriptive passages about the underworld, its origins, and so on.Some of the characters could use further development (Ben/Ashley) but otherwise are quite satisfactory in keeping up with the story's tight pace. A salutory first effort!! I'd like to see more of Mr. Rollin's future works, most especially if they're about caves.",1

This album has many of the songs featured on the program. On the program, the singers and instrumentalists had solos. The album lacks these brilliant interludes.

369,"The worst of all movies: I have never seen anything like that. The most lame, the lowest of all cinematographic works! The acting below any standard! Script? is there any script there??? Language... the most atrocious of all Polish speaking! Comedy??? Do they know what comedy is all about??? I couldn't watch the whole thing. I think it would take a bottle of vodka to be consumed before watching that atrocity!!! Not worth a cent to pay for. It looks like Polish cinematography is dead!!!",0
370,"cute but chinsy: So I absolutely adore the way this watch looks. Its so cute and stylish. But my mind changed when I got it in the mail. The band was super short and it would only fit on the last ridge. It was very cheaply made and poor quality. I couldn't imagine this watch could stand through much. It just felt chinsy and fragile. I returned it because it was tight and uncomfortable. I don't even have a big wrist, between 6 & 3/4 inches and 7 inches. I was really sad because it was so beautiful. Let's face it, this watch was only made for looks. But I didn't want to pay $80 for a super small crappy watch that doesn't fit. I expected more, this watch retails at $250!! what a rip off!

I really like the fact that it is less acid. We have tried decaf and it is just as good. I have recommended it to several friends. Try it you will like it. It is worth the little extra that you have to pay.,1

As of 8/26/2011 I'm still waiting for a replacement. The response to my email request for shipper and tracking information was, ""We use FedEx.""

381,Great Book about the Back-to-the-land movement: This is one of the best books I've read about the back to the land movement of the late 60's and early 70's. It is both insightful and enjoyable. Well worth reading. Her experiences and writing style really bring the period to life.,1
382,Applicable to MFC v2 not MFC v6.: I bought this book to learn MFC version 6 which the book claims to cover. The examples do not use any of Visual c++ wizards and I was constantly battling to try to get Visual c++ to accept the example code. Additionally it is only when you get to chapter 17 that the author reveals that all the examples in the book have been written for MFC version 2 and chapter 17 gives a brief overview of version 6 and the class wizards. I gave up on the book at chapter 5 and have made good progress using only the help and examples found on the Internet. I think your money would be better spent on a more current book.,0
383,Depressing...: The book is poorly written and very biased. Most of the analysis is not comprehensive and leaves many unanswered questions.,0
384,"Fun, but....: When we first got this it was alot of fun. The kids love being in front. The problems I had with it was that the kids legs are right up against the handle bars (we have mountain bikes). This also made it hard to get the kids in and out. Also, our kids are fairly tall, and the legs of the seat don't go too far down, so they out grew it very fast. Our kids are also very thin...but if they were bigger, I can't imagine them fitting in this too comfortably. Also, wehen they fall asleep, there's no head rest, so their heads would kind of flop around. At one point, I had to take one hand to support my son's head.I'm not going to go through the safety pros and cons of having them up front versus the back. I think in the end it's your personal comfort.",0
385,Don't Buy This: If you value your time on the phone like I do you would not buy this phone. I made a grave error on the day when I purchased it. I have had this phone for about a year and it is terrible.

My phone dies at least 50 times a day. I don't even have to tell my friends anymore they can tell when my phone is going to the graveyard. All I have to say about this phone is R.I.P,0

387,Challenging for a 6 year old: I bought this for my kindergartener. Now that we have figured it out (I found the onscreen guide easier to understand than the booklet that comes with the game)he really likes it. He does need an adult nearby to read things such as pop-up hints to him. He also was scared by the eerie sound effects but they can be turned off. He is still at the easy level and I limited him to just one character to play. The game is pretty slow on our aging Pentium 166 and it takes a while to move from place to place in the park.,1

This tape does not give away secrets of illusions you have seen on T.V. performed by greats like Copperfield, Sigfried and Roy or anything you saw on Worlds Greatest Magic. All this film does is hurt the local Magician in your area who may have saved up enough money to bring one of these illusions to your local mall, fair or school. When are people going to learn that when you know the secret, there is no more magic? If you really appreciate magic and magicians, don't buy this tape. Use the money to go see a real magician perform.

403,"Absolutely necessary: I've got an Aiptek HD 1080p video camera. It's great, except for the fact that the default minimum zoom gives you like 5 degrees to work with. But with this here lens I can see twice the amount I could before. It's probably not necessary for cameras that come with a decent view radius, but for cameras like mine it's almost like it was designed specifically for it. Not only does it fit perfectly, but there's zero loss in picture quality that I've noticed. I'm not exactly a professional film-maker so I couldn't tell you the nuances, but as an average person I can definitely say this is a good buy if you want to expand your camera's radius. Plus since it snaps on with a magnet it's easy to remove if you want to zoom in farther. I really can't think of a negative aside from its size; it's like twice as big around as my default lens.Oh, also, the lens says .45x on it rather than .5x. I don't think most people would mind, but it's a point of...stuff.",1

I feel that the Sennheiser PXC 250 headphones are a great purchase (along with some rechargeable batteries).",1
405,"Renaisance festival or DUNE?: It was painfully obvious that the screenwriter and the director had never read the original novel. For all the special effects they gave us they never were really able to give us a reason to hate the harkonnens, to like the atreides, or to fear the fremen (or the sardukar). The actors were awful, the costumes were hideous, and the music was mostly heisted from the David Lynch version. No one really felt any pain and suffering, it felt like one big gay renaisance festival, full of chipper little renaisance folk. Skip it, unless you like that kind of fruity crap.",0

408,"Schopenhauer in 90 Minutes by Paul Strathern: The thinker, Schopenhauer has a series of complex writingswhich underlie academic discussion around the time of Goethe.Schopenhauer felt that the universe would be blind withoutpurpose or the concept of being. The concept of a free willbrings with it misery and suffering as practical consequences.Hope tends to be free of the egoistic side of man. Goethedebated frequently with Schopenhauer. The fact that all colorsare an amalgum of light and dark lay at the foundation ofGoethe's discussions. Schopenhauer believed that the willpermeated everything. In fact, when the will replaces knowledge-the result is obstinacy and ignorance. As an illustration,the author showed that a true impression of someone could begleaned in letter-writing. This work is good, if you are astudent of Schopenhauer ; and, you find the need to integratehis works into a unified whole for interpretive purposes.",1
409,"Alternative: By the way, I highly recommend ""the little yellow dictionaries by gummerus"" Finnish dictionary as it is excellent, contains many useful phrases as well as useful words and though it is enormous in content (60,000 entries compared to the Hippocrene Consise's 6000) it is no larger in physical size.

It started off well and the first scene was interesting and well written. However, the book soon became bitty and repetitive - it seemed more like a collection of short stories that had been artificially linked rather than a well planned book, with characters just disappearing from the story after initial encounters. The concept of the book was a good one. Unfortunately the realization could have been an awful lot better.",0
413,"The Conspiacy Club by Jonathan Kellerman: I have been rading Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels for years and I have really enjoyed them.

414,"not just for vertical applications: I've been using this glue for many years and have gone through at least three gallons of it. I am a trim carpenter/ cabinetmaker. None of the work that I have done with this glue has ever caused a problem, indoors or out. I like it because it doesn't run and any squeeze out just beads up, then after the squeeze out hardens partially, I can easily remove it with a sharp chisel. This characteristic is of great benefit in doing stain grade work. It also has better gap filling qualities than ordinary yellow glue, and although I always strive for perfection, there may be the occasional open glueline. I feel that this glue creates a joint as strong as any other alpiatic resin glue. My only complaint is that it is not available in gallon containers. I've never been able to find it in anything larger than 16 oz.",1

416,"Great coffeemaker . . . if it worked: Overall, I was impressed with this coffee maker, except that it had one terminal flaw. The filter housing swivels out for easy access. However, the catch mechanism is flawed. It is flimsy plastic and on the first coffeemaker it broke off. On the replacement pot it appeared to work fine, until you started brewing coffee. Then, as water dripped into the coffee+filter, the catch would pop due to the added weight, swing open dribbling coffee all over the counter top.The company I dealt with was great to do business with. I explained my problems. They provided return shipping both times and gave me a full refund. I would consider a newer model of Braun coffeemaker, but I would want to see the reviews first, to see if they addressed this problem.",0

423,"Great for Recording Lectures: I upgraded to the DS-30 from the VN4100PC and the difference in quality is very noticeable. I originally purchased the VN 4100 PC for my daughter to use in college to record lectures in class (not a lecture hall mind you but a normal size class room). While the 4100 would be okay for recording your thoughts or ideas, it was inadequate for recording in a classroom setting. You had to strain to hear what the professor was saying, making the whole experience of listening to previous lectures a less than enjoyable experience. That's when I upgraded to the DS-30, which records in stereo. More importantly, the quality of the recording is dramatically better than the 4100. If you want to record lectures the DS-30 is the one to buy! Yes, it costs more, but it's worth it.",1

Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood. So I thought I would give this one a try.I really wanted to like this movie. It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick. I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop). Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it. Way too thick for me.,0

My favorite song is Stand Inside Your Love- the lyrics are very moving. I also like Glass and Ghost Children, Wound is really cool, With Every light is peaceful. Most of the songs are listenable, some are extremely likable. Hopefully Everlasting Gaze and Stand Inside Your Love will be popular on the radio so the backstreet nsync thing wears out and the pUmpkins can be the gods of TRL and the radio. That would be schweet. Machina is worth a good listen. Possibly good music to sleep too. I thought the album would be heavy rock like everlasting gaze and heavy metal machine. But those are the only two songs. Most else actually sounds similar to Adore though Corgan say's it doesnt and nobody else does. I dunno, maybe its just me. Anyhow, give Machina a shot.",1

It's more expensive, but at least they are willing to help you with and stand behind their products.",0

452,"This is not even CLOSE to GTA3: I wanted to take this game back after about the first 25 minutes of playing it, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if it got better with time. Sadly, it did not. The graphics are mediocre, the music is terrible, and the missions are both frustrating and boring. The only slightly fun thing about the game is the CHAOS mode where you can randomly mow down innocent civilians with a chain-gun, but even this gets boring pretty quick, as the same people just keep reappearing. It's very sad, considering how great GTA3 was. I hope Rockstar Games releases GTA4 soon to get the bitter taste of ""State of Emergency"" out of our mouths.",0
453,"Would not eat it.: This is my first negative review of a product but I felt I should leave a comment. If I could give this cat food 0 stars I would as my cat simply walks away from it.

Don't get me wrong, it's good metal, and great MUSIC, but not great METAL. If you take out FFF, She-wolf, and The Disintegrater and put them into an EP with some of their older songs played live, Then it would be great metal. Those three song are the only metallish songs in their. the rest are just mainly hard rock and alternative. Overall good album, could've been better, I give it 4 stars. And for those of you who think Metallica has soldout, you don't appreciate good music. And they don't care what people are saying. They are still making millions.",1
468,"I guess you get what you pay for: I am a beginner to DSLR photography. I recently bought an expensive (for me) 18 - 200mm lens for my Nikon D40 and wanted to protect that purchase with a UV filter. I chose this one based on price. Unfortunately, this filter has led to distorted photos for me. It's OK outside in normal sunlight; however with pictures that I take inside (particularly when using the flash), areas such as people's hair get a weird looking sheen (for lack of a better word) to them. It also seems to cause a less than sharp focus. I finally took the filter off after a couple of serieses of disappointing photos, and now my pics look as sharp as ever again.",0

The sound of the waterfall / rain sound almost exactly the same. The quality of the sounds are horrible. There is some odd back ground noise on the thunder storm sound. I am still on the hunt for one of these machines that actually has a 'RAIN' selection that sounds like RAIN!! But don't bother putting any money into this brand... the sound quality is very poor.,0

474,"Very Disheartening.....: This book did not do what I had hoped it could coming from the makers of the operating system it covers. First, the book itself did a poor job in covering the many aspects of Windows NT 4. It barely covered the most basic aspects and left out a great deal of NT. The CD-ROM included had some decent labs for beginners but there were not enough of them. If you are looking for a book to purchase for preparation of a Microsoft exam for MCP or MCSE this one should be left out. Everything covered in this book can be easily found in just about any other book dealing with NT4. While it can bring a person who knows nothing of NT to knowing something, it presents hadly any new knowledge to users with even a little NT background.",0

Can't burn our own DVDs, can't seem to edit and save in I-movie, can't work with saved videos without having the camera hooked up to the computer (which makes it impossible to continue shooting family footage).

480,"A great spiritual resource...: I own this book and have given it as a gift...it's just, purely, a great spiritual resource for those seeking a prayerful connection with the divine. Williamson offers prayers for just about every circumstance, both personal and societal, that people can face. There are even prayers for the nation, and for reconciliation of historical and political problems. The other good thing is this book addresses the divine but not in a way that would seem biased...people with a variety of spiritual backgrounds would find solace from this book.",1
481,"Started Off Good But Plummetted: This lousy book started off with a decent premise, based quite accurately on research performed by electricity genius Nikola Tesla. But then, it got silly real fast. I abhor thrillers that are detached from reality. In this one, the protagonist, an agent for an American intelligence agency, pursues the mysterious drainage of electric power from the European grid. But then the book deteriorates. It reads like a comic book or a bad B movie. Things get preposterous. This is one of those books where the superspy is superman and everything just happens to be in place for him to save the world. In other words, a bunch of nonsense. The book has little depth and falls into the category of junk.",0
482,"Not for me.: The idea of new GALACTICA has a lot of potential but what we see on this DVD is greatly flawed. The complaints about the pacing are true and the writing could use improvement as could some of the characters. I could go on but it would only fall on deaf ears since GALACTICA, like all sci fi shows, has attracted a loving throng of followers many of whom think this pilot for the series is worthy of 5 stars. It's too bad GALACTICA fans can't be objective enough to note the problems and call for changes. This could be the start of something great but it seems that most of it's fans think that this is right up there with the very best Science Fiction as it is. I say there's room for much improvement and if this is the best GALACTICA can offer then GALACTICA isn't for me.",0

Interspersed with refreshing elements of revolutionary ideas, the momentum soon diverts into clichee and the reader is left with a pile of pulp made soggy by tears of boredom. Chance encounters with spritual beings are downgraded to the most primitive element and the fun ends there.

It is the type of material that routinely follows a chapter in any textbook. Though the questions are to the point, my objection is that it is published as a separate book at the price of many complete works. Properly published, these questions would not add 90 pages to the original text which was itself under 300 pages. The questions did not help me understand the material, only tested my recollection. I feel that publishing this material as a workbook is only a marketing ploy and cheapens the product.",0

I also purchased the Handheld version. What a ripoff!! I only need the device drivers but can't get them without purchasing the Handheld software. Even attempting to use that version alone, by installing the data files rather than running from CD results in the program not being able to find the data files. The data files, incidentally, are exactly the same as the standard version but it can't find those either. Not an improved program in my estimation, but a rather poor update. Tech support is useless as they don't even respond to email. They've done such a great job of hiding their phone numbers on their web site that I've given up trying to find one. Would be a long distance call anyway, they dont' have 800 numbers to the best of my knowledge.Unhappy DeLorme customer.",0
506,"Very Decent Bench: I picked up this bench to use with my Powertec Power Rack. I love the way the bench slides into the rack when your performing Incline, Decline bench or Shoulder Presses. Great looking bench as well.My gripe with this bench is that when your benching (flat bench), there is some sway on the back support. This can be improved by tightening the bolts, but guess what? When you tighten the bolts too much it makes changing positions very difficult. So its almost like you either keep the sway and have an adjustable bench or you remove the sway and lose your adjust-ability. I will probably end up picking up another bench solely for flat bench and keep this bench around for everything else.If it wasn't for this, I would have given this bench 5 stars.",1
507,"This Cat Should Stay In The Hat!: The Cat In The Hat is one of the most disappointing movies of the year and one of the worst. Mike Myers should stick to balying British secret agents and leave the Dr. Seuss characters to Jim Carrey or an actor more willing to make a family film. Myers is not funny and comes off as trying way too hard, and even puts in jokes that I thought were too dirty for a movie with Dr. Seuss' name at the top of the title. The production designs are annoying and all the supporting actors come off as annoying, especially Alec Baldwin. Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning are good as the children, but they can't save the movie from Myers, usually a very funny actor, just not meant to play this role. Save this one for the litter box!",0

On one occasion he had played some classical type music during the practice.

I have no idea why, but it was definitely the new filter as when I put the old filter back in the smell stopped. It was entirely nauseating, and obviously makes the filter unusable. In addition, Small Appliance refused to offer any help, and told me I needed to have returned it within 7 days. I never realized I had to test out my filter so quickly in case it stank! That's not something you're supposed to have to worry about with an air filter. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in both Amazon and Small Appliance for their failure to help with this problem, and I will not be likely to buy anything from Small Appliance again, or to purchase this filter online again from Amazon.",0

This story gives two ideas of what things were like back then: how dangerous life was, and what alchemists discovered while searching for a way to change base metals into gold. I liked this book so much I didn't care that it was history!",1
528,"Not worth the time and money: There is no point to buy this book if you already have the book of Gang of Four. Good help to understand all the patterns is using simpler examples than what Gang of Four used. Unfortunately, this book was unable to take the advantage of Java language to use simple examples to illustrate the point and concept of each design patten.One star might be too mean. However, if we are saying what someone already did, it would be better to use simple examples and make it easy to understand. Otherwise, what's the point?",0
529,"Mean, Twisted, Sadistic: This book is a how-to manual for child abuse. Whipping 4 month old children because they are crying? As if they are able to communicate in any other form! Continue beating children until the crying turns into a ""wounded, submissive whimper."" If you like this book - please, give your child(ren) up for adoption. Sounds like you don't love them and you don't deserve him/her anyway. Maybe they'll have a chance in life after all.",0
530,SanDisk 8-in-1 Reader: This reader worked great right out of the box. It comes with the docking station with attached USB cord and a second 6 inch (approximately) USB cord. I attached the docking station to my computer and I just slide the reader onto the top of it and I'm ready to go. I use the short USB cord on the front port of the computer for other small plug & play equipment. The reader will show up as 4 different drives in the My Computer folder making it easy to view and load the files you want. It's very light weight and easy to pocket and take with you.,1

533,"Do not work in all pedals.: Just received these and I'm sending them back. They just do not plug in fully to all pedals I own. They work fine in Boss, Electro Harmonix, and directly into either of my two amps, but just will not plug in fully, or receive a signal through Sansamp, Biyang or Catalinbread boutique pedals. The groove between the tip and the shaft is definitely about 1/8 inch wider on these than all other 1/4 cables or patchcords I have. I suspect this wideness causes them to not be able to click in fully on some jacks.",0
534,"One of the better books on the runes: There is a lot of garbage being printed about the runes and most of these authers do not know what they are talking about eighter. But Freya Aswynn is diffrent she knows her craft well. She does not just give out iformation on how to read the runes or the divination meanings of each rune, she goes deeper than that. She goes into the esoteric meanings of them. She also gives out a bit of information on some of the goddesses and gods of the Nordic pantheon. Her work is orderly and not sloppy.",1
535,It was a complete disappointment: Judith McNaught is my favorite romance novel writer but she really disappointed me with Night Whispers. I was expecting it to be as good as Perfect and Paradise and I was shocked when the hero and heroine made no impact on me.,0

538,"Funny movie: If you like a mix of action and comedy, this movie is a good bet. While the story line is a bit of a stretch, following former CIA agent Frank Moses out of retirement and teaming up with his old gang to find out who is out to kill them is a pure joy. A lot of the humor is dry, but works well with the story. There is plenty of action and shooting as well as humorous situations they gang finds themselves in. I am definately recommending this movie.",1
539,"Nice to get your mind of things...: The book is entertaining. it's not as hilarious as some critics said it would be but if you are looking for a fun and light story to get your mind of things then this is the book...it did not keep me awake until the early hours of the morning but I enjoyed reading it. It is well written, interesting characters, good pace of the story. Get under the duvet and enjoy this book ! (and don't forget the box of chocolates!...)",1
540,"Not much that I found useful: I was very dissapointed in this video. There is little useful information on color matching, unless you own an off-white boat. About half of the short (38 minutes) video you watch the author sanding on a boat hull, and stiring pigment into gelcoat. I didn't pay [money] to learn how to sand and stir. Several times the author refered to his gelcoat matching kit, and how you could order it from him. Also, the video quality and directing is poor. If I had known this, I would have saved myself some money.",0
541,Not Good: I bought this camera when I realized I had left mine in my husbands truck & I was leaving on a girls trip. Didn't do any reasearch. Many pictures are blurry & this camera is SLOW in processing a shot. With the many comments about battery life I suspect that is the problem. But even fresh batteries don't seem to help. ONLY good feature was I literally pointed it in the dark & using the night time mode & the pictures came out really good. But something else. This one is getting passed on to my employees for their work vehicles in case they ever need a camera.,0

543,not that into it: The blu ray played great. I'm not a blu ray fan. Have a lot of bad experiences with them not playing right. The movie is good. It has a good story to it. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy it. Special because it keeps your brain working.But it's not for me. I'm not a bright person and this movie puts me to sleep. I have this movie added to my collection because my husband likes it.,0

Save your money and hope the next version is better!!",0
545,"Pointless: this movie is BEYOND POINTLESS! I don't want you to go through what I did, which is sitting through this violent and disgraceful story thinking that in the end there is going to be some sort of statement made. If you don't know that dealing drugs and threatening people with guns and shooting people will eventually get you and your associates in prison or killed, than maybe you are just ignorant enough to enjoy this movie. I liked the film Belly because it at least had a positive message about transformation and choosing a better path at the end. This is a pure disgrace. It sensationalizes, glorifies, and glamorizes extortion, violence, and the objectification of women. It is disappointing that a child of Bob Marley, who has his father tattooed on his arm, would be part of a film as negative as this. The fact that this film got so many positive reviews on here does not reflect well on humanity.",0

549,"Great stroller frame, bad cup holder: This stroller frame is a great product. It is very easy to unfold and fold with one hand. It handles very smoothly on bumps and brick paths. The one negative is the cup holders are too shallow. I had a hot cider that spilled on the baby's blanket thank god, and not her skin. So beware of putting any drink without a secure cap in the cup holder.",1
550,"Blasphemous movie....: This movie is pure filth and blasphemy against our Lord, Jesus Christ. It's an attempt to bring Jesus Christ down to a level of a sinner and a sinner is what he was not. Would it make any more sense to make a movie about any other historical figure and conjure up a life that never occurred, especially in this case, where scriptures state He was blameless. To read some of the reviews praising this movie and labeling the faithful Christians as ""narrow minded"" is narrowmindedness in it's own right. There's no room to speculate when it comes to spiritual mindset of Jesus Christ. He is God, blameless and died for the sins of all mankind. The movie and book is a work of satan.",0
551,"No new songs. They need to change DJs. Boring, Boring, Bor: Since the previous reviewer seems to find novelty in the included tracks on this CD, maybe he's the one that needs to get out of his little world because all these tracks have been over plyed over and over. This MASTERBEAT always recycles the tracks after they've been heard everywhere else. Besides, they used one DJ exclusively. Very seldom, do they bring in a new DJ. I've been to Puerto Rico & I can vouch that they listen to a variety of new music, plus they listen to more than one genre not just recycled hits.",0
552,Reality Learning: There are not a sufficient number of accolades for this book. Highly recommend as a way to learn historical truths and realities -- often these are not exposed. This book was purchased and read with the encouragement of the PBS series.,1

With my MIL's current pill box - each days worth of meds come OUT of the main container - she then keeps them in a pocket or on her walker tray.

I was disappointed - AGAIN.The Apex Medi Tray is the one we have now or one very similar - but when I ordered another one on Amazon - it came in BLUE and you cannot see the pills inside - impossible to tell is the pills have been taken unless you open each window.

554,"Sticky residue; charger plug gets hot: Right after opening the package, I was not impressed. When I removed the screen protector from the transmitter unit, it left a sticky residue behind. Maybe this is because of the humidity and temperature today, but they should use a different adhesive on the screen protector.The charger runs hot. Like another reviewer suggested, maybe it would be better to get a separate charger and transmitter.I initially tested it in my living room with my main stereo. I was not impressed with the audio quality of the transmitter. (I have a power supply with a cigarette jack that runs off 120 VAC.)",0

556,"a profound disappointment: I wish I could impute a more positive rating, but I cannot find the wherewithal. The content of this putatively ""absurdist"" collection was such as my twin three-year-olds could readily pen without a moment's preparation. Noting that Kharms was among the authors represented, I expect to at least see something of the quality of his ""The Old Woman,"" but I did not. It seemed as if the anthologists sought high and low for the poorest, leanest possible representation of every participating author. Vvesensky (yes, that's the proper spelling) was a waste of paper. I didn't even bother to delve into the other three or four ""writers.""I assigned two stars because the typography was clean and the grammar of the translation was excellent.",0

My wife thinking she was being helpful renewed the two accounts with Microsoft's 1 month subscription of $10.99. This was a re-occurring charge that would have come to a total of $131.88 for one year of X-Box Live. Now times that by two, $263.76! I didn't even realize what she had done until I reviewed my bank statement. I quickly went online to find the cheapest solution and it was Amazon. At $39.99 for one year I quickly grabbed two and canceled the re-occurring monthly from Microsoft. Amazon shipped free in two days and we were up and running. My savings annually overall was $183.76! Thank you Amazon!",1
560,Amazing: I really enjoyed how two people from two different worlds were able to find love. They accepted each other as an individual and not try to change their ways or thoughts. I knew love would prevail because opposites always attract. It was a joy to read how their love would finally come to life and how they would let it take over. There was suspense and adventure in this story and a lot of history. This is a book I would recommend and I will read it again.,1
561,"AMAZING FLASH!!: I was very delighted when I opened the box and held this flash in my hand, it was compact but felt like such a good hardy flash. As a Professional Wedding Photographer who uses the Canon 580, and 550 flashes, I needed something as a backup flash to use on a light stand to light up the Dance floors at Wedding receptions. My assistants love this flash too, it's a little lighter than the 580,and the 550, so they would rather have this flash on the flash bracket than the heavier ones they use. I seem to have no problem with the recycling time, it's super fast. The manual control is so easy to add or take away light. The bounce feature is great too. This is a great flash for the money.",1
562,"Brews coffee with a taste of rubber or plastic: I ordered this item through Amazon. When it arrived I followed the instructions for cleaning the unit with the cleaning packet that was included. After running two cycles with clean water I brewed a pot of coffee and it tasted very bad, like rubber or plastic. I thought that this was due to the unit being new. After four or five brew cycles the poor taste persisted and I returned the item for a refund. Additionally, the dispensing spigot leaked a few drops after filling each cup of coffee. I was very disappointed with the product. The brew station is a good idea but it fails to deliver a good cup of coffee.",0

565,"Kutless: A great first album, with memorable rock songs. I might buy this CD just for the song ""Your Touch"", which has to be one of the best Christian rock songs I've ever heard. What I like about Kutless, is that I can listen to my favorite music, rock, without having to hear cuss words, or, a popular thing with rock artists, look at trashy CD covers. I would highly recommend Kutless to any rock lover, Christian rock lover, parent looking for good rock music for their child, or anyone looking for a cool new band.",1
566,"Didn't last a day: I don't have anything to say about how hot this thing would get because I took mine out of the box, plugged it in, and the green light would start flashing. I did check the instructions and trouble shooting, and I will say this is the first time I've had to read the owners manual for a heating pad. Anyhow, there was nothing in there about that symptom; I could not use the control to turn the thing off, and it never got hot. Bummer, now my neck still hurts. Guess it's another night of Icy Hot.",0

568,"I hated this book!: The Power of One is an epic story that simply is not believable. Five-year-olds don't do math for 12-year-olds, for example; nor do they have the kind of insight that PeeKay shows as a five-year-old. In fact, few adults have that kind of maturity. Many of the adults in the book are not good and certainly don't act in Peekay's interest -- Peekay is sent to a boarding school where he's two years younger than anyone else and is English at a Boer school What do we suppose would happen? Of course he'll be treated badly. It's a soap opera, and not a very good one. I read it for a book club and considered it a huge waste of time.",0

How stupid is that. And Will Smith is just horrible in this movie. This is your typical ""The world is in trouble, it's USA to the rescue"" movies, and is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just think of all the starving kids they could have fed by not making this thing. Instead, they waste tons of donatable dollars to give us this moronic waste of time. Pathetic. It's not 'I'll watch it to make fun of it' horrible, it's just plain HORRIBLE. Period.",0

I've had them detach quite easily on a couple occasions as well when i put my hand on the clasp while carrying it on my shoulder, (since it's a rather natural place to rest your hand.)

An excellent change of pace from many of today's games, which are sometimes over-complicated (not that there's anything wrong with that either). Two-player cooperative play is extra fun.Two not-so-minor things that keep this from being a five-star game. First, the characters (you and enemies) are too small...often times it is hard to determine exactly where you are on the screen. Second, in the two-player mode, your characters are hard to distinguish from each other. This leads to additional confusion, especially given the first problem I mentioned above.Still, this is a very fun game, easy to pick up and play, and the graphics are excellent if perhaps a bit too overwhelming.",1

This little mp3 gives off great sound, takes batteries, and is really light weight. It is easy to see and figit with. The buttons are so accessible that I can even change songs when I am running.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with an armband... at least the version I purchased.

It is hard to study for the exams because it takes a long, long time to study a book of this size. I forgot some of the things from the first part of the book by the time I got to the last part of the book. You might want to consider using a short study guide to prep for the exam after working through this book.My advice for the A+ exams: Be sure to pause after the hardware stuff, prep for the exam, take the hardware exam, and then move quickly into studying for the OS stuff.

599,"the game sux: this game isn't that great. all you do is shoot stuff, and you beat the level. it's easy, and boring. hte only good part is the amazing multiplayer mode. but over all- i say it sucks. Metroid Prime for Nintendo Gamecube is a lot better. if you have a gamecube, get that instead",0
600,"VERY POOR PRINTING QUALITY - SAMSUNG ML-2010: I never write reveiws, but in this case I had to: the quality of the printing was so poor. Like other reviewers, it prints grey not black no matter what you do. Also, there's banding. Plus, you get nowhere near 3,000 pages with the toner. Also, I saw no difference between the 1200 and 600 dpi setting. It also disturbed my power source.What else can I say? Samsung should be ashamed of turning out such a poor machine. Too bad there are not lemon laws for laser printers.",0
601,"a classic?: This is my first Jules Verne book, and I must say that I'm disappointed. This is a ""classic""? Everything is viewed from afar. Verne never let me feel as though I were right there. There is almost no dialogue, and even the action is related as though it were second-hand. Although I didn't expect it to be in Jane Austen's league, from its reputation I was hoping for something in the range of Stevenson, Tolkien, and Wells. It's not. This sort of storytelling is more of the Edgar Rice Burroughs or Stephen King variety.",0
602,"Heating problem: I have used this product(Waring Pro DB60 Portable Double Burner) for a short time. The first few times the small burner worked, now it does not heat properly--does not heat up in a timely manner. It maybe a problem with the switch on the small unit. I don't know the exact problem, but it is disappointing.",0
603,"Poor Quality Control: I purchased this knowing full well that this value brand probably was going to be slightly inaccurate. I was fine with it being off by a couple of thousandths or so, but the product I got was terrible!The reading would fluctuate by over 2 tenths! TENTHS! It will read 1.8"" when it should've read over 2 inches. Even opening the caliper very slowly, the number would sometimes jump down by .3"" before returning to the correct value a few hundredths of an inch later. I'm going to try for a replacement. Hopefully the one I received was a fluke and if the replacement is better, I will change my review.",0
604,"Danielle is slipping: I've noticed in the past 2 years that Danielle Steel's books are slipping. It's taking me forever to continue reading this book. I find myself putting it down. That never happened in the 1980's and 90's. Her books were gold. My husband used to joke that I would get one of her books and pretty much finish it in 1 day, 2 the most. Now her books are not written as well as they used to be. I think the last good book I read of hers was The Wedding and Bittersweet. I have continued to buy her books (up to date) hoping they would be like they were in the past, but they're not. I don't know why her writing has changed or maybe she's putting too many books out too fast.I miss the old Danielle Steel writing.",0
605,"Frustrating for kids of all ages!: If you value your sanity avoid this program. The lengthly introductions that begin each time you start up the game cannot be stopped. I was twenty minutes into the ""game"" before any real action occurred, causing one of the four children present to comment, ""There's too much talking!"". The four kids present (ages 3 to 8)were bored and frustrated as we tried to actually fulfill the promise of building the farm. I finally illegally shut down my computer as it was impossible to escape any other way. As an avid Playmobil toy buyer I was very disappointed to see the quality of this game. The graphics are initially exciting but the structure of the game is so poor I couldn't recommend it for that reason alone. This game is like a one lane highway that doesn't allow for passing and when you finally exit and hope to travel somewhere else you find that you're right back where you started!",0
606,"The Illuminated Blake: The only possible complaints that one could have with this book are 1)there is no color reproduction and 2)it is a softcover. However these same factors contribute to the wonderfully low price as a hardcover, full-color reproduction would bring it into the price range of the Princeton Blake. I must make a reference to one of the other reviews and say that in contradiction to the reader from Portugal's review this edition DOES contain all the Illuminated works with the exception of the one page work The Laocoon which is not exactly one of the illuminated works. Erdman's commentary is excellent, as is to be expected from one of the three major Blake scholars of the twentieth century. This commentary makes the book a value even if one already owns the Princeton series.",1
607,"Dreary and Depressing: I am sorry to say that I liked neither of the selections on this CD. There are two of them; they are different; but they might as well be the same. Each is a long droning instrumental ""background"" with a very occasional voice to wake you up...maybe.These two compositions are not at all like some of Mike Oldfield's long works. There is very little to distinguish between the beginning, middle and end. It seems almost as if 15 or 20 seconds could have been recorded and set on repeat. The same is true to a lesser degree for the second piece.Some may like this for background or mood music. I'll pass.",0
608,"really infectious stuff: This wonderful release contains Oh-OK's two tiny EPs along with live recordings and also the track ""Random.""The first EP (tracks 1 - 4) titled ""Wow Mini Album"" has probably some of the best songs on here, despite the more elementary/simplistic sound. With only bass and drums (not to mention Linda Hopper's fine vocals) each song is perfect. Especially the wonderfully short ""Lilting"" (it's only a minute long) and the catchy ""Person.""The second EP (tracks 5 - 10) titled ""Furthermore What"" moves from the jerky post-punk that was featured on the first four tracks into a more jangle-pop territory. ""Such N Such"" and ""Elaine's Song"" are simply amazing.Oh-OK came from the ever fertile Athens scene from the early eighties; and what review could go on without mentioning that the leader and bassist is also Michael Stipe's sister? That statement isn't saying much, though -- Oh-OK sounds a lot more like Pylon than R.E.M.Which, in my opinion, is a very good thing.",1

612,"I love David Gemmell: I begining to find that in a lot of writting what carries a story through is not the story itself but that fact that the author seems to care so much about what he is writting that is why I love this book.As it opens we learn that a formerly great tribe The Rigante have been virtually enslaved to another race of people(the Varish). I've noticed this too is a constant theme in books by this author one book will close and things will be going fine and than in the next installment it is 100 years later and things have really gone to hell in a handbasket.I think of all the books in by this author this is my favorite except of course for ""Legends"". In fact Jam reminds me a lot of Druss the legand.Overall-wonderful read have read it through 3 times",1

620,"Good, solid effort.: I was really impressed by Robert Crays latest offering 'Sweet Potato Pie' and it is certainly one to grow on you. While it doesn't offer up the quick thills of a 'Strong Persuader' or 'Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark' it is another self assured and consistent effort which will please fans. Though it combines both upbeat rocking numbers as well as slower ballads - it is the down tempo and reflective tracks such as 'Not Bad For Love','Simple Things' and 'Little Birds' that really hit home.",1
621,"Osman's Dream: History of the Ottoman Empire by Caroline Finkel: I began this book with great anticipation but was very disappointed. It was difficult to follow the author's stream of thought and the historical lines, i.e., date, years, decades were repetitive to the point of confusion. The characters moved in and out of the pages, seemingly without rhyme or reason. There was obviously an effort by the author to remove or dilute much of the historical evidence of violence associated with the Ottoman Empire. I completed this book only because I refuse not to finish a book once started.",0

623,Party favors are not instruments: You are paying for a soft case that comes with disposable party favors. The included harmonicas have brass reeds but are otherwise completely plastic. Very little of the air you blow will make it past the reed resulting in you blowing until your red in the face to get a squeek out of them. Hohner should remove their name from these.For comparison I have a couple of $30 Hohners and my wifes $10 Hohner and both are far superior to these.,0

If you want a longer, harder game, then you shouldn't be playing it on easy mode. ... Also, don't look at your final time as the time it took you to beat the game. Each time you restart at a previous point your clock resets to that time. I clocked in at 8 hours and 44 minutes (I know I spent more time than that) ... This game is truly a piece of art. You want everything supersized, go to Mcdonalds.",1

The Bosch reps don't even know how to use their own product. We contacted several (3) all with different info NONE of which was accurate. It will find angles, but a protractor for less than a dollar will do that. We were also told ours did not work, so we bought a second one. Well it worked like the first!! Save your money.",0
627,"What kind of cruddy game is this?!?: This game is quite possibly the most horrific game to hit the X-Box yet! I've seen some crappy graphics, but this takes the cake! The many horrors of this game are terrifying, and that's just the begining! First of all, the graphics are so bad, the characters' lips don't even move and This game's structure is so bad you'll die for no reason, and this game has a tendency to glitch like crazy during two-player mode. This game is a compleate mess. Lucas Arts must have put it together in one weekend. They just slapped a title on a piece of pitiful junk! They just needed some game out just to have it out. This is a sorry excuse for a game and a waste of money, money that could have been spend on something more useful, like toilet paper. I recommend KOTOR or just plain anything else expect this.",0

Gameplay is vayiayed depending on the skill of the players and the amount so when you have 4 players skilled or 8 skilled players [with LAN] then the gameplay is quick and fun. Although it was not as fun as the mario raceing game for the n64, there are many unlockable things so you will be playing until your thunbs fall off. The best part is the multiplayer battles. There sveral modes but the same stages for all three modes. I would give this game 5 stars out of 5 stars because there is always a race to win or a game to play.",1
632,"Fun game and easier for littler children!: After my son got his tonsils out, we bought a gameboy, but I was having trouble finding games that were appropriate for his age (barely 4 yrs old).This game is perfect for him! The best part is that there is no time limit to complete levels (expect for maybe two levels throughout the whole game) and there's not TOO many bad guys. Also it seems that it's really easy to get extra guys, so he can play for a long time uninterrupted without having to start over and get frustrated.Great game for young ones!!",1

Thank god I borrowed this from the library! I mean! I was really expceting the second coming of rock here!! And it just did not happen. Then it hit me that when it originally came out I never heard one song on the radio, not even college radio (the second clue!).

647,"Kafka in Estonia: Knowing nothing about this movie, I checked it out of the library, and couldn't avert my eyes for a single moment. A warning: some scenes are so brutal they're difficult to watch.Every scene was masterfully photographed in black and white: perfect faces, beautiful black automobiles, barren landscapes, rubble, tall peeling churches, a relic of Christ on the cross, the interior of a modern building with wires coming out of the sockets, an allegory, I suppose, of any Oppressive Regime.The dialogue was superb. So was the acting.Which brings us to the final question: What was the movie about? And does it even matter?No matter that I didn't understand the plot. The movie was like biting into a succulent fresh pear. Each bite - each scene - was a brilliant slice of life that we only view in night-time dreams or in great films.",1

651,"It feels very, very rushed.: ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a great story, but this particular edition falls flat. The book's description is nonexistent, as the entry refers to 'classic works' that should not be forgotten, with no mention of the particular product in question. The author's source is clearly labeled in the back of the book, which itself is poorly edited and checked. There are spelling mistakes and the paragraphs are not indented (giving it copy/paste appeal with no formatting). Even the table of contents is incorrect. The table of contents.At 8 1/2"" x 11"", it feels inelegant, more like a textbook than a classic adventure novel. It's possible it was designed like this, but most likely the larger format makes for an easier packaging of other large classic works.It's Jules Verne, which is a great thing. But there may be better, more attractive editions to gravitate towards.",0

Since I had enjoyed the two releases Smile and This Is What I Hear, I figured I would go for it. Well the CD was release in mid 90s. I have listened to it in my car driving back from St Louis (where I bought it) and now at my office. Several tunes are quite catchy. My fav is I'll Be There. There are several other tunes which are a bit more mellow. The track titles also convey a spirituality to the CD which also made me quite comfortable. Although this format generally likes to promote the guest artists which appear on the CD, Tim Bowman opted to just make good music. Enjoy!!!!",1

I paid extra to have this book rushed to me, and I am so disappointed. His rapid fire prose has been cut to such ridiculous levels that it's not enjoyable. A typical sentence ""Pete flipped on the light. Pete grabbed the door. Pete swung it open. Pete walked out."" That sucks!, and it's irritating to read. I love Ellroy's writing style, but this entire story feels ""phoned in"". The characters are deflated: the new characters seem to be given almost no personality, and the story inches along rather slowly.I was looking forward to reading until 4 am, his books are impossible to put down, but this one was so boring that I actually took down American Tabloid and started re-reading that.",0
659,"Her Best: Of all her albums (including Fox Confessor...), this is the best. First, it's staggering that her voice can be as amazing live as it is on the studio albums; really, it's something special. Second, her 'magnetism' comes out much more in the live recording than it does in the studio albums. When I listen to the studio albums I feel like something is missing; what is on this album is exactly what's missing. It's like the difference between a Grateful Dead live album versus a Grateful Dead studio album (well, maybe not that severe, but you get the point.)I'd recommend buying this album before any of the others. Standout tracks include 'Train From Kansas City', 'Soulful Shade of Blue', 'If You Knew', and 'Rated X'.",1

666,"A Journey with Alice: I thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was what the Disney movie was based on, and Through the Looking Glass was another adventure she had. But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one.",0

671,Not quite worth it.: We had this for almost 2 years before it started clicking and went out. Called the company and were told that it would be 35.00 plus shipping for a new circuit board. After reading reviews on the item we decided it was not worth it. We too experienced it having a mind of its own when it came to setting the temperature. We almost got our money's worth.,0

675,"Ok...: I read this book for a project for a Criminalistics class for a Summer camp. I was looking forward to learning about Typhoid Mary and all about her problems as she lived her life carrying the deadly typhoid. I was a little disappointed to find out that a lot of the book was about the context of the life she lived in. I'm sure that for some...that would be a nice touch, but I was looking more forward to reading about the case than about society. But other than that, I thought it was a good read. I found myself laughing quite a bit, thanks to the clever way that Anthony Bourdain narrated this novel. Not a Number #1 choice...but not the worse i've read either. I'll let you decide.....",0

The book seems to be missing the ""Meat"". All the samples are very simple; some are rewrites of what comes with the actual program(ie: calculator, and drag and drop game). I actually regret buying this book, next time I will read the first chapter of a book before buying it. You can't judge a book by it's cover, or the graphics inside! Hope this review helps anyone trying to decide what book to buy.",0

The seat should go further into the counter, more mesh with the surface - no one would consciously sit this far away from the table edge. I used something called a Sassy Seat when my daughter was little and it was compact and easy to transport. This seat is cumbersome and doesn't travel as easily. I wasn't that impressed so I returned the second one I bought.",0

687,"Terrible Dog Toy: I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab. When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable. Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth. I definitely do not recommend this item.",0

This is misleading, to say the least! Once you read the introduction in the manual inside the box, you learn that you are part of a battle of horse academies. Descriptions like ""a reputation for ruthless efficiency"", ""crushed its competitiors one by one"" and ""battle of the academies will take no prisoners"" provide a much darker game description. It isn't fun! I am returning my daughter's game immediately!",0

Too much of good sound sometimes can go overboard, and that's exactly what happened here. Every tune is very unique and so fat (full) that instead of balanced mix there is a struggle for a better space.Not to mention the selection of certain musicians with so much amazing music out there right now. I mean 'Burma'? Really? Two U.N.K.L.E. songs? Double Really? Oh yes, also our fav underground DJ, in the compilation of 10 placed the very special, truly underground genius of FELIX DA HOUSECAT.

695,"Fail.: [...] While it might be useful to a foreign learner of English, with such ""useful"" advice as, ""A verb is an action word in a sentence!"", it has some deficiencies that limit it for both native and foreign speakers. Many of the games require you to know the meaning of a word in advance, otherwise you'll simply be playing ""guess which meaning is the right one"". That is not a good way to learn new words. It can be a good way to reinforce what one already knows, but that goes against the entire point. As a linguist myself, I seriously question this product.In addition, the process by which your abilities are rated is entirely artificial. Even scoring perfectly on many of the games (I already have an extensive vocabulary), I was rated as basically a simpleton in order to preserve the illusion that I am ""improving"".Not recommended. Language learning software has tremendous potential, but it isn't even hinted at here. In fact, it's made to look laughable.[...]",0

697,"Indispensable: This is a greeat book, though not a perfect one - but certainly a welcome and necessary addition to any Vietnam era reader. Stanton is not really concerned with politics of strategy, only the performance of the Army and Marines in combat in Vietnam and, more unusually, how the Regular Army reacted to the war. Densely written and without enough maps, it certainly is a bit difficult to read, but it is worth it. He covers all of the major operations and battles of the war, including the ones usually ignored by historians. Stanton unfortunately has a strong bias against the ARVN and doesn't bother to conceal it.",1
698,"Great buy for gender neutral: I purchased this book the week before I had my baby and I absolutely love it! I was looking for a baby book that had the first 5 years to fill in along with options for celebrations, stories about how mom and dad met, birth story, etc. It worked out great. You can remove and change around the pages and it also has lots of space to add pictures along with photo corners. I had trouble in stores trying to find a gender neutral book as we did not know what sex we were having and this cream/brown color worked out great! The ink pad for hand/foot stamping is also really nice as in the hospital they only stamped my daughter's feet and not her hands, so I was able to do that on my own at home without a big miss. I definitely recommend this baby book!!",1

706,"Roller Derby beginner: These skates are okay for Roller Derby. I am a fresh meater and used these twice so far and they work just fine. In fact everyone wants to know where I got them because they like the ""rims"" notice the inside the wheel silver (it totally looks like a rim when you are up close and personal). The skates do run a bit large in length but are a narrow skate. I ordered an 8 and wish I would have gotten a 7. I wear a mens 9 so I should have ordered a mens 7 but at the time there were none on Amazon, there are now though. I think for the $44.00 I paid for them I got a huge bargain compared to the other skates the girls on my team have in the $100 price range. Also Derby and Skate sites charged up to $60.00 in shipping alone to Guam and Amazon shipped free and the skates got here in just two weeks! Overall I say yes they are fine. I will be adding some insoles for comfort and to add to the skate since mine are too big.",1
707,"Mullets across the Med: I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney.",0

The spots wouldn't come off and the entire interior took on a dull finish from plain dish detergent and a sponge. Save your money,0
712,"Perfect for the beginner studying the Tarot.: I absolutely adore Ms Morrison's writing and books, so I was very excited when I finally ordered this and got it in the mail. I was never very familiar with the Tarot before I read this, and after reading this, I feel that I have a much greater grasp of it. Her writing style is to the point and friendly without being too aggressively-friendly, which makes it easy to follow and charming to read. Her meditations with each card are treasured, and the spells are varied and simple to use. She also gives personal stories about her experiences with the Tarot, which help the reader (especially the beginner) to relieve any fears or doubts that they might have. Although it isn't the ""most definitive"" text on the Tarot out there, it is certainly one not to be missed.",1

In the end, I chose to get the Ella Enchanted one, and I'm sure glad I did!

I couldn't help but feel the beautiful spirit in that room as I read those words. She was very special and was preparing to return to the Master and I felt His love for us as I read. After we finished the book my little girl went to the bed and held her great-grandmother's hand, I went to hold her other. She passed on about five minutes later.

This book would be a real page-turner, even for those not related to Martha Hyer. Particularly insightful is her life with big-time stars like Gene Kelly, John Wayne, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn, and Elvis Presley, and her late husband, Hollywood's mega-producer Hal B. Wallis. Once you get through all the awe and glitz, however, there is a message that is inspirational to each of us. Life is not just about catching that big wave and trying to hang on. My Aunt Marty has seen life with the high and mighty, the rich and famous and all the baggage that goes with it. The good news is that she's managed to survive it and gain a better perspective that she's willing to share with us all. She's still working on finding her way. And her book helps us do the same.",1

Basically the game suffers from sacrificing gameplay variety to tell a good story which it does tell a good one but there's no need for gritty realism especially in a video game.

The two core members of the group are Tim Whelan and Hamilton Lee, but they often go by pseudonyms in album credits. Here, as usual, Lee is ""Mantu,"" and Whelan is listed as ""A. Ahlan."" At this early point in the band's history, the singer Natacha Atlas was one of their great attractions. She sings on 6 of the 16 tracks, including ""Temple Head,"" which is no doubt the band's best-known song.This is a masterpiece of world-ethno-dance music, with great beats, vocals, lyrics, and overall flow.(verified purchase from Zia Records in Tucson)",1
750,"very disappointed: I fell in love with Andrea Bocelli singing Time to say goodbye. It brought tears to my eyes. Today it still manages to do that every time. However I was not happy with the rest of this album. The Spanish version is not recorded well - it sounds like it has a lot of static. If you plan on playing it loud like I do the static get in the way of enjoying it. I thought that most of the songs would be in the style of Time to Say Goodbye - they were not. I have yet to hear the whole thing because each time I listen a little way into any other song it drives me absolutely crazy.Would I but it again? Yes, just because I love the one song so much. But the others really aren't worth the time or the money.",0
751,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!: This thing did not work from the moment we took it out of the box. It was incredibly frustrating. I was able to take it back and get a different model and that one seems to be working just fine. My daughter was upset because she thought the pink one was so pretty. But atleast she has one that works!!,0

755,Awsome camera in a compact size: This camera has to be the best point and shoot digital camera on the market for the price and for the Sony quality it produces on the picture it takes and the the fine quality it can print.

Shame on Memorex for making a device that is so exclusively for Windows operating systems only.,0

765,"Cheap Chinese junk: My son bought this pump, and it stopped working. I disassembled it and found several problems. The machining of the valveseat contained metal burrs preventing it from reaching rated pressure. It kept blowing fuses so I traced the problem to the motor windings. One of the wires was sticking out of the rotor laminates and was rubbing against the motor case. Construction and assembly overall was very poor, and I predict that it might work for a few hours, if you are lucky, then quit. Trying to find a quality made pump in this price range is difficult.",0

770,New York in your pocket: The best thing about this book is it's size it fits handilly in your pocket. Planning a visit to New York in February 2002 i did hope for more from this guide. Its size limits the entries to a few lines which is the books main problem. The Bars section may come in useful but Virgin will have to do better if they want to rival Time Out's NY guide.,0

774,"display quit after a year: This was a good system with all the features we wanted in a phone until the display on one of the handsets went blank. This happened just a little more than a year after purchase (hence, after the limited warranty ran out as well). E-mail to Panasonic support resulted in regurgitation of what can be found on the Web site and offered no resolution. For the price of the system, I would expect the phones to last much longer than a year; a replacement for one handset from Panasonic will cost another $44 plus ""tax and recycling fees.""",0

777,"Not worth the hassle: GOOD: I picked this controller up because it looked like it would be perfect for people with larger hands. Well, it does fit well in the hands but that's the only thing good about it.Bad: The buttons are too close together so you sometimes hit 2 at a time. Then when you need to press Y & B together, it frequently doesn't work or you end up pressing the black(clear) or white button accidentally because they are (1)placed in the old area on top vs. the bottom and (2) they are too close to the other buttons. When I took a punch from a fighter, it began to vibrate but wouldn't stop for about 20 seconds (stuck). The buttons are also too close to the right stick. I kept bumping it while pressing B or X. I used this controller for about 1 hour on Tao Feng and 1/2 hour on Matrix, then I chucked it in the trash.Good luck.",0

His lyrics & music are well written & proformed. He is a huge asset to the music in- dustry & he should be reconized for his abilities. I wish we could see & hear more of him. I had the incredible pleasure to see him in concert several times, all of which left me for wanting more of his music. My favorite is Hold on to the Night I have devised a work out program to his Repeat Offender CD. Great for working out and Cooling down.

The author is nothing more than a closeted anarchist that doesn't understand how reality works. He himself is everything that he accuses the government of being; hypocritical, greedy, stupid. He goes on and on about how the government wastes the tax payers money and how it is constantly seeking more and more of our hard earned dollars and then goes on to talk about how he doesn't want HIS money to fund Social Security or to go to anything that would help any special interest groups. Dave Barry is a humorist, this man is a moron.",0

I tried a cheap one from target, Norelco nose and hair trimmer. It broke after about a week. Being as dumb as possible, I ran out and got another one. It broke a week later. So, I went on Amazon and got this one. Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose & Ear Hair Trimmer. Apparently I didn't read it well enough to notice that it is not powered. It works ok, but it feels like it is pulling out your hairs more than cutting them.This trimmer, however, is wonderful. It is a breeze to use and clean up. It doesn't leave a bunch of trimmed hairs in your nose because of that vacuum. I am quite pleased with this product.",1

So, I deleted all the songs and tried it on a different computer. Everything seemed to work just right: connected on first try and moved songs onto the device with no trouble.

That's a tough act to pull off without dipping into dreckiness. The Chicks don't disappoint. However ... and please don't flame me on this ... I strongly prefer their earlier CDs musically and instrumentally. Why? I miss the bluegrass and acoustic elements. While they're here as salt and pepper in the mix, Rick Rubin's production leans every track into 70s-era FM-ready country-rock in the Eagles/Asylum Records/Jackson Browne/et al mold. Yes ... the 70s Asylum catalog is a priceless section of my music collection. But that doesn't mean I want THAT sound with TODAY'S Dixie Chicks CDs. So ... four stars, not five.

The book description boasts ""containing comprehensive and informative information on the subject,"" but it's lacking severely in this area. I suppose I purchased this book in hopes that I would find a condensed version of some of BMEZine's articles, which are well thought out and full of information. This book read like a series of poorly pulled together magazine articles and often times, the photos occupying the articles were either misleading, misplaced or lacking any further explanation. What also disappointed me, and someone has touched on this before, any person who identifies themselves as a member of the ""body modification community"" can easily point out many of subjects in this book. These people are already well publicized and very vocal. Although they are extremely interesting, they no longer command my attention. This book was a letdown.",0

Even Santa is reduced to a hopeless weakling without the power of a dog.

812,"A grin from beginning to end: ""The Assistants"", a novel by Robin Lynn Williams, is a hoot from beginning to end. The characters are well delineated and each appealing in his own way. The author apparently had a bad experience with Hollywood agents, because she depicts them as stupid, greedy, and devious incompetents who depend entirely on the neediness of their clients and employees for their success. Especially amusing is Rachel, a na??f who hails from a small suburb of Houston and believes that all people are basically good and honest.

831,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK BY HEIMERDINGER: When I first heard that the main character was going to be Harry Hawkins in this book I thought for sure that this book and The Lost Scrolls wouldn't be as good as the first for with Jim Hawkins as the main character. To my suprise it was just as good as all of the other Tennis Shoes books (which is really really good.) I can't wait to read Heimerdinger's next book.,1
832,"Boring......: It's like a 70 min (Or however long the cd) track which sounds the same all the way thru, and goes nowhere! I've heard a fan of his mix describe it as 'Icey' ... and that I agree!I like mixes which take you on a journey (A Cliche I know!)and have a bit of variety. This does neither. None of the tracks on this album are a)dark b)deep c)warm d)funky e)originalI listened to this 3 times, so I gave it a chance.I am actually Digweed fan, just giving an honest opinion. 1 star.. because the mix is technically perfect and obviously considerable effort went into making this. Digweed plays much better in clubs, I felt his fabric mix was a better indication of the true 'Diggers' sound.",0

Had an unknown local actor played Baldwin's part it might have been good. Federal Hill, however, was quite good. It completely captured Providence and Federal Hill.

842,"Disappointed, but still a Firm Believer: I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, but this tape I would recommend only for first-timers/beginners. For the reviewer from Canada who remarked the tape is over before you know it, that's because it is a rather short workout, and very easy. I hadn't even broken a sweat yet, and the instructor was already into the final stretch! The music is uninspiring, and the workout choppy, meaning you only do a few repetitions of one move before quickly moving onto the next, and so on.... This video I would skip, and spend your money more wisely on The Firm classic workout series.",0

844,"Agree with those who didn't finish reading this book: The book has essentially no plot and the same kind of dialog and sex scenes that previous books contain. No originality at all. Enough with these men who know immediately that this is the woman for them and manipulate the woman to come to that realization by using sex and self control, when their instinct is to dominate. Booorrrring. I didn't finish it and that's rare for me. Perhaps some readers are not familiar with the entire series, thus found something enjoyable here.I have read books by Laurens from before the Devil's Bride, Cynster Book 1 and she had some talent. I must say that her male characters are almost all exactly the same. In a few cases they differ a bit but the general idea and technique is the same, over and over. She has been coasting, I'd say since Cyster Book 5 or 6.",0

Katherine presents the love interest, though she dies of jungle fever at the end. In one scene, that is typically Crawford while at the same time seeming ludicrous, everyone involved in a tiger hunt automatically ""dresses"" for dinner each night, as if they were on Park Avenue. Also there is too much talk in the book, something that Crawford would become expert at, which only deadens everything. Crawford would write much better novels than this one later in his career.",0
847,"Elvis lives: I have viewed this concert several times and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It really made me believe that Elvis does still live. When attending concerts unless we are seated in the first rows we tend to watch the performers on the big screen therefore for most people in the audience Elvis was performing live in this concert.Watching on TV the editing was so good that a viewer could not detect the difference between Elvis on tape or when he was actually on the stage with the other musicians. Having the split screen with the musicians in the past and live was so cleverly done. When Elvis turned around and mischieviously smirked at the other musicians you really could believe that he was actually performing live in this concert.I have been buying this concert as gifts because I really feel it will be a treasure in any DVD collection. Visitors to my home, who have watched this concert say they want to own it too and I have given them the ordering information.",1

It's not worth it -- especially since there is a form in the back of the book offering additional copies of the book for $19.95.Like a previous reviewer, I publish a weekly newspaper and I am always looking for ideas to boost sales. This book does have few useful tips, but it gets lost in all the hype. It is primarily about newsletter and e-mail advertising. It also goes into the history of the Ziff-Davis company.Basically, if you can find this book for around $10-$15, it may be worth a purchase, but anything above that is a rip off. Don't be fooled by the title and the hype. The most ""amazing formula"" was the title that guarantees book sales.",0

I wasn't scared, didn't laugh, wasn't grossed out, wasn't anything and I couldn't wait till the movie finished. I even thought I'd like it more after meeting the cast at the latest Fangoria Convention in Burbank last year, but they had to know what a piece of garbage they made here.

The plot was interesting, but it just never grabbed the reader and got them involved in the storyline. The main villan just seems like another everyday psycho. What happened to the excellent espionage that Follet used to write?The strong and caring relationship between the FBI daughter and the SFPD father was a definite positive for this book.If you are a true-blue Follet fan, you will make it to the end of this book albeit with the hope that it gets better as you go along.",0

He's an actor from a time of the big time actors, such as Bogart, Spencer, Stewart, etc..., who really had his own niche in Hollywood. This film is the perfect setting for his subtle and understated style. It is well written and directed, showcasing Otto Preminger's unique camera angle set-ups and lighting. Every acting performance is top notch, a movie that ""owns"" the film noir genre.",1

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of how our economy developed into the state it is now as well as to plan for the future. It gives me chills to think that some of our greatest leaders could have commited the acts documented here. This should be required reading for anyone wanting to get out of the rat race.Why only four stars then? Even as an avid reader and fascinated by the material, this book is very, very long. I read it from cover to cover, and don't regret it, however a lot of people were intimidated by the size and subject just looking at it. Based on that, I recommend using the author's guidelines for getting the most from the material without being overwhelmed.Bottom line: If you don't like where the economy is or your role within it, you need to read this book.",1

Anytime a character is anthropomorphised by showing a desire to live and is successful as a result of some level of intelligence and yet gets destroyed at the end - I get a little bummed out. I certainly wouldn't enjoy reading this to a child never mind explaining the celebrated cruetly at the end of the story.

It details his difficulties, many self-caused, and his many ""uniquely positive"" incidents. (Yes, that was contradictory). Additionally, the extreme political correctness of the author (as with most authors/academics, it seems) makes him constantly abashed at the class snobbery of early 19th century England. Well duh! You can't judge the actions of people divorced from their culture.It also leaves the impression that the map shows the geological layers beneath each point, whereas I think what it actually says is that the map only shows the rock types of the top layer - a far less amazing accomplishment.Written by a brit to an colloquial audience that knows the geography of Britain well, as an american I found at least a third of the book incomprehensible.",0

That says something.This is one of those recently rare albums that you listen to all the way through, maybe on repeat, until it seeps into your surroundings and infuses your world with its rhythms and colors. For the sake of comparison, other albums I put in this category include Dylan's ""Desire"" and The Velvet Underground's third, eponymous release. ""Title TK"" is a mood, and a complex mood at that: melancholy yet whimsical, impressionistic yet precise.I think this one is going to sneak up on people and become a cult classic in 15 years. Just a hunch.",1

Still, it's a terrific, quick read that made me feel like I had traveled all over France and North Africa by the time I finished.",1

920,"CLC BigMouth Bag: I have owned many CLC bags over the years and had to recently purchase this bag as a smaller bag to use as a communications tech. This bag is the highest quality bag out there that you can find. It offers a multitude of storage possibilites in a convenient small sized bag. CLC products have never let me down in the past and that is why I have stuck with this brand. If given the opportunity to use a different brand, I just wouldn't even consider moving away from CLC products.",1

Older & vision impared people will have a problem with this keyboard... Like putting on reading glasses to see the keyboard, & then removing them or putting on another set of glasses to see the screen.Normally I like Logtech products, but what the heck where they thinking of by shrinking the letters & numbers so much? There's plenty of room on the keys! Use it!I had to switch back to my 8 dollar keyboard so I don't need any glasses at all to type or use the 'puter.",0
922,"This book is a great resource!: This book, which emphasizes the unique characteristics of the gifted learner and the fact that such children are ""not a homogeneous population,"" presents a big challenge to parents looking for the right 'educational fit' for their children.But it is full of valuable information for those who seek to better understand gifted learners, intelligence testing, educational programs for gifted children and more. I highly recommend this book.",1
923,"Save your money: It arrived when expected. It's a nice size and light weight. That's where ""nice"" ends. I'm taking a trip to Russia in a few weeks and thought this would really be of help. Well, it isn't. Yes, it does translate from English to Russian but NOT into phonetically spelled words. It translates into Russian using the Russian alphabet. If I could read the alphabet, I wouldn't need the translator. Next, the screen is very difficult to read under any lighting conditions. So, what I have is an expensive currency converter with a bad screen. A $5 calculator would serve a better purpose. When I complained to the company, their response was for me to buy a translator from them priced over $400. Somehow, I don't think so.",0
924,"Good for 3 days: I waited over a month to get this and was really looking forward to it. I've used it for 3 days now and the seal between the inner and outer walls (it's double-walled for insulation) is broken - there's moisture in there and brown droplets of coffee. I only washed it by hand and it's been carefully handled. Too bad, because it's a great idea and it makes good coffee.",0

926,"Worked okay at first, but now disappointed in the product: I purchased this collar based upon reading the positive reviews left by other Amazon purchasers.At first this collar worked fine, but over the span of a few weeks the performance appears to have been seriously degraded. Even with a full charge, the max range on the collar is less than 25 yards. This obviously is no where near the advertised range of 400 yards.The collar/remote design is nice, but this is a mute point because the thing does not work as advertised.Based upon the recommendation of a professional dog trainer, I have ordered a tritronics unit. My only regret is I should have ordered the tritronics first instead of purchasing the sport dog",0
927,"Not That Good!: The Trials of Tiffany Trott really left something to be desired. The characters were one dimensional and boring. Half way through the story I could have cared less if I even continued. The premise of the story is that Tiffany Trott is a single girl, who mind you gets dumped on her birthday and is trying to find love. She places an ad in the paper and gets a number of responses. One is from Seriously Successful, whom she falls for. But, the catch is he is married. She works hard to meet someone else ... and as you can tell ends up happily ever after (or there about). I really wish that the story could have been more interesting. Create some characters who a 30 something woman can feel for. Instead I read this wondering how she could write so many pages of dribble.",0
928,"Great soundtrack for a great movie: One of the things I love about this soundtrack is that my teen son wanted it after seeing the movie repeatedly. I found him playing it, loudly, while playing LOTR games. What a great way to introduce children to orchestra and choral music!Dramatic, haunting, harrowing, so many words seem weak.",1
929,"ALERT TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED!!: I cannot even tell you how excited I was to finally have bought the remaster edition. Look at the Amazon listing....it says ""English Subtitles"". Well guess what.....there are none. It has FRENCH and SPANISH...but NOT ENGLISH. Someone at CBS or Paramount or whomever actually made this for the ENGLISH speaking AMERICAN market needs to be shot. And Amazon too, since they incorrectly list this.I am hearing impaired an need subtitles. The non- remastered edition has English subtitles-- which I already own. The clarity looks so good on the remaster, but sadly I cannot hear much of the dialogue or read the actor's lips when they are off cam and speaking. A huge blunder and disservice to hearing impaired / English speaking fans. This error far exceeds the stupid dual sided disk, where you cannot tell what episode is on each one.I am sure people without hearing problems will love the remasters......",0

932,"He likes the little balls...: ...but completely ignores the Tiger.My son received this as a gift on his first birthday. Everyone thought it was adorable and his 3-year-old cousin enjoyed knocking the basket with her hand a couple times to set off the music and lights, but overall it was a disappointment. As others have mentioned, throwing a ball in the basket does not cause any effects -- the ball usually just stays in the basket. There is no incentive for my son to learn to throw the ball into it (unless we cheer wildly -- and, well, that gets old), so he just plays with the balls by themselves.Great idea, but doesn't work.",0
933,"Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera: I went from a D60 to this new body, the Rebel XT. The body itself is a bit flimsy feeling to me, but the IMAGE quality if outstanding. I compared it to the 20D, and decided the Rebel XT was just as good, perhaps even a tad better. I do feel the camera body is a bit small for my hands, so I bought the Opteka Battery Pack Grip (from Amazon), and now the camera feels much more substantial & robust in my hand.All in all, I think the Rebel XT (350D) is an outstanding camera, especially image quality, and a FANTASTIC value.",1
934,"Bad History: A hilariously bad film, very loosely based on the experiences of Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox. The film wishes to avoid the obvious hypocrisy of slaveholders fighting for (their own) liberty, so planter Marion here becomes farmer Gibson, who has freed his slaves. At the time, the colony of South Carolina was sixty percent black, but here the region is virtually all white, with the exception of a single slave who fights in the state militia in exchange for his freedom. (In reality, the SC Assembly banned free blacks or slaves from serving in the state militia.) Following the burning of his plantation, Gibson then arrives at the plantation of his sister-in-law; she too has freed her slaves. Evidently they are the only two whites in SC to do so. The screenwriter, who wrote Saving Private Ryan, knows better. In fact, this film is so inaccurate that one might fairly regard it as racist.",0
935,"I've always been a boring condom user -- ...: I've always been a boring condom user -- generally purchasing whatever spermicide-treated condom was available, so the Trojan Ribbed Lubricated Premium Latex Condoms were a bit of a change. Fortunately, there's also a version with spermicidal lubricant. These particular condoms are comfortable and effective and we encountered no problems using them. The ribbing contributed to extra sensation as well. This is a good, fun product!",1
936,Compassion: On this double dvd the Buddhist nun Pema Ch칬dr칬n gives explanation about the tonglen meditation. Tonglen means give and take. We are inclined to avert us from pain - of ourselves and of others -. This meditation helps you to open up your heart and let compassion grow for yourself and all sentient beings.I personally work regularly with victims of the genocide in Srebrenica (Bosnia) and find this method a true gift. You do not need to be a buddhist to let this method transforms your attitude towards pain and let it increase your bravery.(sorry my english is not very well),1

First of all, you can't tap on carpet so if you don't have a tv by hard floors you can't tap and watch the dvd at the same time.

943,"SOULFLY KEEPS THE BRAZILIAN METAL SCENE ALIVE!: (...) very inventive and provoking percussion helps this cd flow right along mixing heavy jams ala the 'ol ""Sepul'"" days with instrumental world ideas and native influences. Fans of the old school sound and maybe even some nu-metal kids (after being converted) might just get the tunes they've been waiting for all this time. This lineup seems to be the best one yet. Just bought this cd at 4pm and am already jammin' it twice! Do yourself a favour and grab this edition while you can. When you buy the disc it gives you a ""key"" to exclusive live tracks on the internet! Doesn't get much better than that. (...)",1

There is a little lever used to lift the hot toast further out of the toaster. The footprint of the model is fairly small, it seems very modern with the blue lights, and it makes a decent slice of toast.",1

The scoop dropped the dough really well - much better than any other scoops I've tried in the past! It might work even better if I chilled the dough first.I'm enthusiastic to use these scoops for biscuits, cookies and anything that needs regularly measured batter (cupcakes! muffins!)",1
948,Like it BECAUSE it is small: I purchased this turban because some of the reviewers said it was very small. That is exactly why I ordered it because many others I have purchased slide off during the night. I like the way it looks. I like the way it feels and the fact that it stays on. I like it because it is small.,1

950,McNabb Eclectic And Electric: The Icicle Works were always Ian McNabb's vehicle into musical explorations. Anthemic compositions combined with top-notch musicianship make this collection of songs an enjoyable listening experience. What makes it difficult is also what makes it fun as McNabb constantly assumes different musical persona's. A commercial liability but a treat nonetheless this album captures McNabb in transition from being a group member leaving the 80's behind to becoming a solo artist in the 90's.,1
951,"What A Disappointment: I LOVE the Washington Post. I have been reading it since I was 10 years old. So, I was very excited to see it was available on the Kindle. I immediately got a trial subscription. Boy, was I disappointed.Most of my favorite items, such as comics, The Reliable Source, Real Estate Matters, are not included in the Kindle version. The way the paper is formatted is also not what I expected. Titles are missing and, well, it just doesn't LOOK like the paper.I am, very unhappily, canceling my Kindle subscription and waiting until it is a better product.",0

We made waffles the day after Xmas and with the 1st waffle in the right hinge broke off. Undeterred, I continued to make a couple more waffles.It's very easy to use but the instructions state you should let the waffles cook for 5 min. That's too long, the waffles were too dark for our liking. After I pulled the last waffle off, the left sided hinge broke off! Seriously, B&D; what a piece of junk. We couldn't stop laughing, it was too unbelievable. So back in the box it went and returned home w/ my mother so she can return it. Sorry kids, looks like it's back to frozen store bought waffles for you.",0
956,"FINAL INSTALLMENT OF L.I.S. ENDS WITH MORE OF A WHIMPER THAN A BANG: But it's still good to have the complete series now. I'm a little more forgiving of the picture quality than most reviewers have been.I know it should be better,but it could be worse.Before the DVDS were released, all I had were bad VHS recordings of selected episodes from the SCI-FI channel.So I'm grateful for the release of the entire series. I'm quite disappointed there aren't better bonus features.However,the episodes are fun to watch.And that's what really matters",1

The substitue was not of near the same quality and would not hold up to any yard work....We will be sending this back as we did not receive the product we ordered. They should not substitue a product unless they conduct the customer for approval. Very shady.",0
958,"Good points, yet it bored me to tears...: on average, i read about 12 pages per hour...which isnt very good for me because i am normally a very fast reader. the preface was a very horrile opening to the book because it wasnt interesting enough to excite the reader, even if they are very interested in this subject, like myself. once i got to the main chapters, i was a little more hopeful to read about some of the events that may have went on during our countries early beginning. i found that the author made very interesting points, yet his writing style was very tedious and extrememly hard to follow. he used run on sentences, repeated phrases,and got off topic. i must have read over the same sentences at least 4 times. in addition, i thought he over-analyzed some things. yet, if you are a historian who is very interested in this topic, then i would recommend it, otherwise, spare your self the time and effort that it takes to read this book.",0
959,Il Barbiere: I really like Teresa Berganza but I wasn't wild about this particular production because it wasn't recorded live on a stage. It was more like a movie version ofIl Barbiere which I didn't know prior to purchasing the DVD. That aside it is still entertaining but if you are purchasing this to see the singers technique up close than beware because at times during the chorus scenes Berganza doesn't even look like she's singing but her voice is still heard in the ensemble. The only explanation I can think of is that they must have pre recorded many of the ensemble scenes so that the singers didn't have to sing the whole time only look as though they are singing. Order this if you don't care about those kind of things but I am a voice major and those sorts of things don't go by unnoticed.,1
960,"Poor Quality Product and Poor Service!: The poster arrived quickly, but it was very poor quality.

They just won't go in. What a waste of money (that I don't have to spare). I guess I'll try a live trap next and drown them. I really hate the thought of that though.

966,"I'm going to save you the trouble: The author writes an entire book about recipes which anybody could find in any cook book or online. The ONE and ONLY thing you want is on page 50. It's the reason why just popping a bud in your mouth will not get you high. It has to be cooked for the THC to be extracted and since THC is basically an oil, butter works best. I wasn't going to do this, but the author didn't even get that right. He tells us to combine the butter, ""leaf"" AND WATER in a ""stockpot"". Not true, what you want is a double-boiler to simmer the LEAF WITH BUTTER for 3 hours OVER THE WATER THAT SIMMERS UNDERNEATH AND NOT COMBINING THE THREE MATERIALS. When it's over, strain and press the buds to get all the juice. Refridgerate overnight and use the butter to make cookies or whatever (which fills in the rest of the book with standard recipes).The other snippet of info your probably looking for is whether Police dogs will know that they are pot-brownies, the answer is YES they will.",0

As in BAD bad.""Screaming Skull"" and especially ""Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman"" look awful. ""Werewolf"" includes some of the strangest visual distortion I've ever seen: the backgrounds tend to jitter as the foregrounds stay still. Colour bleed, grain, and poor contrast are all present.The extras include a not very good Betty Boop cartoon, as well as trailers for the main attractions and ""Brides of Dracula.""

If you did not have parents or mentors around who assisted in building your confidence and who gave you empowering and enlightening knowledge about how things work in the world then I suggest you buy both books.The simplest message is that lot's of things are true, even the negative stuff, but it's up to you whether or not you activate these negative things or just ignore them and move on. I think someone said something about ""turning the other cheek."" You can apply this to just about any life experience. I'm not saying that things will change over night, although they could, but this is mateial that can be used for life.",1
969,"Amazing Saw!: I finally got fed up with my sub-standard circ-saw while doing a large deck framing job that required close precision. After researching all the ""pro"" saws including the Dewalt I decided to go with the Skil MAG 77. I must tell you, I am not disappointed. This is simply an amazing saw. It tracks perfectly, allowing you to make not only precision cross cuts but do quick job-site ripping by hand. One of my main reasons for opting for the Skil was its superior gauge design. The Dewalt has an raised arch rim on the front of the foot that makes it impossible to site across the blade and the front reference mark at the same time. The Skil's foot is flat allowing you easily to site across the blade and front gauge. BOTTOM LINE: One of the BEST power tools I've ever purchased - definitely worth the money!",1

I don't know why Cnet and Consumer Reports didn't like this set very much but I am here to tell you that this set is amazing! The only thing is: Be careful with burn-in.

The movie does borrow heavily from Hellraiser I and II, as to the gothic horror it portrays.

982,"Very Disappointing: After all the hype this book has received from the pre-pub press, I was looking forward to reading THE STARGAZER. I was very disappointed. The plot was not credible, the characters were flat, and the writing was pedestrian. Not only that, the book was poorly edited; allowing the author to use word forms that do not exist in the English Language.I cannot recommend this title.",0
983,"Huge disappointment: Simply put, this doesn't work well at all. It gets clogged up with the tiniest algae and even when it is working, the ""fountain"" is a joke. The water barely reaches 4 inches. It might work in a bird bath if it wasn't so huge.",0
984,"Can I spoil it if it's already rotten?: Honestly, I found this to be a very enjoyable read. I looked forward to getting back to it every evening. Yes, as some of the harshest critics have noted, at times the word choice just seemed absurd. But overall I found the prose to be superb. This is easily the best book with virtually no plot that I have ever read.And then the boy is saved at the end and there's some vague Judeo-Christian pseudo-spiritual/philosophical crap that is supposed to pass for seeds-of-hope and a book ending. I was surprised how much McCarthy ruined it in the last few pages. Seriously, I re-read the end three times just to be sure I hadn't missed something in my initial read/reaction.The ""good guys"" live to ride again, and the story is totally ruined.",0
985,"Rieview for the iPAQ h6315: The HP portion of the PDA works fine and is supported by an excellent HP service. But when it comes to the phone part, it becomes a night mare. T-Mobile US is one of the worst service providers. When calling customer care you get routed in a circle and after several call you come back to the first service agent you remember by name, but he does not remember anything.I strongly recommend to abstain from buying the specific product. The ""marriage"" between HP and T-Mobile should be long divorced. A bad taste remains on HP-products as normally they realy care for their customers.Something T-Moible still needs to learn.",0
986,"the unfunniest: This is the film that practically destroyed Harry Langdon's career. Supposedly a comedy it has nothing going for it. Frank Capra disowned this disaster and it's easy to see why. Langdon's comedic characater was very fragile and had to be carefully handled. This film oblitertes it. To appreciate Langdon's talent get The Strong Man, a classic Capra comedy in which Langdon shines and one that the great director was very proud of.",0

I agree with another review posted here that asserts that the ""Jesus"" of Baxter's so-called ""revelation"" bears little to no resemblance to the Jesus of the Bible or traditional church teaching. I think this ""revelation"" can be safely ignored. As a telling side-note, has anyone else noticed her ""A Divine Revelation of..."" series of books? Looks like she started herself a franchise along the lines of ""Chicken Soup For The (fill in the blank) Soul""!! Sounds like money might be the big revelation here.",0

But it smelled of kerocene or some kind of fuel that almost made me sick. It is saturated in something. I don't know if you had it setting in a location that smelled of some type of fuel or what happened to it but it smells sickening. I could not possibly put this on my dog to wear. I am disgusted that I paid for this item. It is totally unusable and not worth even shipping back. It smells so bad it needs to be thrown out. Only you know where you had this item sitting and why it smells like kerocene or whatever fuel smell is saturated on it to make it smell like this. I would never purchase anything from you again.,0
994,"Incredibly disappointing: Don't waste your money on this disc. It is an old videotape transferred to DVD, of poor quality and amateurish videography. In addition, it is not an accurate portrait of Salamanca. It is neither appealing, educational nor professionally done. I have family and friends in that lovely old city, and this recording is an embarrassment to both their cultural heritage and contemporary lifestyle. The strong emphasis on religious processions is not representative (go to Seville for that), and viewers get no clue about most of the city's architectural and natural beauty. The camera dwells on a scene (the university guys singing) without explanation of what it means, while it rushes through others (the bridge over Tormes) where further viewing angles were expected, based on the voice description. In a sentence, this is a hugely overpriced item, offering bad quality video, and scatterbrained narration.",0
995,"Lifeless Review of 60 Lively Years: This surprisingly short (less than 200 pp) book attempts a vast sweep of coverage and falls short. Its failings extend beyond gaps, however, which are arguably inevitable in a survey of this sort. One might more readily excuse the gaps (such as omitting AIDS and the gay rights movement from the ""Protest and Unrest"" section, or JFK's assassination from the section on the presidency), if it weren't for the redundancy of having both a ""Hollywood"" and an ""Arts & Entertainment"" section, plus ""Fashion, Fads & Fun,"" which cover far too much of the same ground. Worse, even those who expect less substance from Life than I may have hoped to see are likely to be disappointed by the all-important photos. Far too many are presented in awkward two-page spreads which are crossed in the center by the book's binding, ruining much of the photos' effect.",0
996,"Why?: If you have ever seen the original ""Tinker, Tailor"" starring Alec Guinness, you will realize what a piece of junk this is.

997,"Foley strikes again!: Mick Foley, one of hardcore wrestling's few living legends, returns as one of its few legitimate authors.Foley is Good picks up where ""Have A Nice Day!"" ended, with the waning days of Foley's career, and some of his best matches against the likes of Triple H and the Rock, among others.His writing style remains the same, stream of conscience, humorous, and rather sloppy style we saw in his first tome. Unlike the first, we see a little more of Foley himself, including his views on the world, stronger opinions, and more of his family, which he clearly adores.Foley's intelligence shines through as well, as someone willing to research and confront an issue, but this is ""Foley is Good""'s undoing. He attempts to be both serious and humorous in his screed against Brent Bozell and the PTC, and his case suffers, especially when he himself admits he doesn't always approve of his industry's actions.Still, it's a great read, and a must for any Foley fan!",1
998,"After a week of every-day listening...: I borrowed this album from my local library from sheer curiosity,not being familair with country music so well - expected yodelling,got songs that went under my skin.I knew that Harris and Rondstadt are good vocal match,but did not expect them to have such interesting taste in material: when you hear ""Damned,damned,damned I am"" in the first song,you know this is something different than your usual pop radio station music.Other reviewers may glow with apreciation of these women work,but for me they opened the door to a new field of music - now I am curious to explore more of the ""alternative country music"".Any album that have songs about WWI soldiers on the way to death and their one-night stands,covers of Sinead O Connor,Leonard Cohen AND Bruce Springsteen shows very unique intelligence,taste and sensibility.Bravo girls,what a nice surprise!",1
999,Not interesting: I purchased this when my son was approximately 10 months. He watched it a few times. I tried it again after he was 1 years old and he still didnt show any interest. I tried another one to see if I would get the same results and he still was not interested.,0

1002,Perfect if used for intended purpose: I think one of the issues with many of the reviews here is the fact that this lock is made for backpacks and luggage. It is meant to be used to secure zippers. I have several of these and have found that they work well when traveling with a backpack.,1
1003,"A moving life lesson: ""A Short Guide to a Happy Life,"" by Anna Quindlen, is as short as the title promises: of 50 pages, 30 are photos and only 19 are text. I was motivated to read the book after first reading Al Franken's hilarious parody of the genre, ""Oh, The Things I Know!""; I would recommend it as a companion text.Quindlen offers some advice pertaining to the title topic. Along the way she quotes Yogi Berra, John Lennon, and Gwendolyn Brooks, and cites the New Testament. I felt the strongest part of the book was her very personal account about how experiencing the death of a family member impacted her.Yes, some of Quindlen's phrases strike me as a bit too self-consciously cute, and the concluding anecdote may be too sentimental. But the part of the book I found most effective is Quindlen's metaphor of having a personal reawakening or rebirth; this section is powerful and well written. Quindlen's ""Guide"" may not be the final word on the meaning of life, but it's a worthwhile read.",1

1005,"Freedom and its price: Of all the books portrayed the turbulance time of pre-independence days, this book is the best. Most of the happenings is in a village but you see the entire India inside that village during those turbulent pre-independence days. The author portrays the unforgiven history through a limited set of characters and with the stunning climax he proves though the human being can be divided by the religion, the humanity always prevails.I always admired Singh's writing style. Eventhough the characters react depends on the situation his writing always hits the point without emotion. And I always liked his ""short story-like"" ending and in this book also he didn't disappoint me. Worth reading and definetly a masterpiece.",1
1006,"enough with the lame '90s ""heroines""!: I found this book to be less offensive than Bridget Jones' Diary, but also less consistently entertaining. I truly wish Bank's editor had forced her to make a choice -- is she writing a novel or a bunch of short stories? The uneven narrative voices often made for a confusing, frustrating read. All downhill after the first chapter, which I'll admit I really enjoyed.",0
1007,"useless: Despite my worst fears, I have a kitty urinator. After lots of review reading and the reccommendation of my pet store owner, I bought a gallon of Nature's Miracle. When I didn't see results at first, I ripped up my carpet and cut out the soiled part of my carpet pad thinking that must be the reason I was still smelling urine. After using the entire gallon of nature's miracle on my carpet, I still have a house that smells like urine and (thanks to N.M) now rubbing alcohol.I'm going to give NOK-OUT a try now, I guess. What a waste of money.",0
1008,Shows what a joke the Oscars are: Too bad the overall movie wasn't as good as the special effects. When the ship starts to sink it actually gets interesting (though the storyline of the herione narrowly rescuing the chained up hunk put me in mind of a show like Aliens where every second counts; oh my will they get out?). Give me a breakUp to the sinking though you have to put up with incredibly bad dialogue and a downright boring story,0
1009,"Very sad and painful to read.............: It was the saddest romance I have ever read. Granted the ending is predictable, but it was a sad journey. It lacked action and passion. There was romance, but not enough of the other two. What I found painful about this story was the main characters having sex as the heroine is suffering from advance uterine cancer, UGH! @. This was a story told in a very Victorian era sort of way. If you have read Kresley Cole or J.R. Ward, this series is nothing like them. I think I'll past.",0

In this writer's opinion, the best songs on the album are, Still in Love, Sure Won't Forget, No Turning Back, Til The End, featuring Kenny Latimore, and Be Encouraged. These songs received heavy rotation on Gospel stations during that period, and Be Encouraged crossed over to the secular R&B Charts.",1
1018,Alot of fluff in this book wish I spent more time in the book store and looked over it more!: This book is REALLY fluff.. No real substance. I really wished I spent a little bit more time looking over this book at the bookstore. I just spent 1.5 hrs and skimmed through the whole entire book. The author glosses over a lot of things that I would think would be important. In particular I was hopeing for more information on USB and CAN interfaces. Two things that are a major part of the newer AVR devices. Very disapointed.read this book at the bookstore! Don't buy it because you can probably read through it in a matter of 1hr or so. This book maybe ok for a complete beginner but if you have had any microprocessor programing experience (I got some PIC) its very limited. Like other posters have stated you can get more info from AVRfreaks.com or Amtel datasheets.,0

I have taught intensive French for over 25 years and was the Director of an Intensive French Program. You simply cannot learn French or any other language ""in no time"", a few key words and expressions perhaps. And of course there are people who are trilingual and are just ""picking up"" French, but in general it is deceptive to claim to be able to teach a casual tourist a foreign language in a few classes. There are plenty of Elementary French books as well as ""method"" type books out there. Some are better than others. This one wasn't bad just not one I would consider using. The pronunciation part was especially poor.",0

1029,"Uneven, mediocre debut: Olivia's song Bizounce was a good funky song for the album's first single, but the rest of this album sounds surprisingly uneven and mediocre. The explicit nature of most of the songs really turns me off. She comes off sounding offensive on most songs as she wants control of the man and the relationship. And the wanting to be a singer then turning around and being a rapper comes off as disjointed here. Olivia needs to pick a style and stick with it. The uptempo numbers lack the punch of what Aaliyah or Mary J Blige did before. And she lacks feeling on some of the ballads. I'm surprised that this album didn't sell well on J Records. Fortunately, she left them and went to 50 Cent's G-Unit Records. I hope she comes up with better music on her upcoming 2005 album for them than this outlandish, offending piece of crap that her 2001 debut brought. Sorry, but foul language on R&B love songs didn't work on that 1st album!",0

This album contains three versions of ""Best Friend,"" the theme song for ""Courtship."" One features Bill Bixby. Another was recorded by Cruz and Mickey Dolenz for the Nilsson tribute album (but it got bumped when Ringo submitted a track). The third version is Cruz's enthusiastic punk version.

Yes, I want to feed myself (and therefore the baby) the best possible choices, but the horrible preachy overtones of this book allow for no slack. Am I really a horrible mother since I want regular ice cream once in a while instead of low-fat ice milk or yogart?The question and answer format is useless as well. Most of the questions that I did have were not in the book, and the few that were answered did not give complete answers, so I had to consult another pregnancy book or my doctor anyway.

He quotes Robbins several times, but more than that, his writing possesses the same strengths and falls victim to the same weaknesses that Robbins' writing does. There is a remarkable and lyrical prose style here, and a precious sense of humor, but in the end, Duncan's wit and his clever epigrams push the story and the philosophy behind the story into a second place position. Duncan's explication of his philosophy is delivered in a cute anecdotal manner that makes it sound very pleasant but provides very little substance. The same can be said of the characters, who are amusing (I laughed aloud several times) but have little or no motivation for their development.

I didn't have a problem with Sylvestra's portrayal of Fanny. I thought she did a good job even if she was not handsome. Fanny was not supposed to be a great beauty. I love the actor who played Edmund. He made me fall head over heels in love with the character. I think the storyline adhered well to the book. I also liked the portrayals of Fanny's uncle and Mary Crawford even though I despised the character. The ending I will admit was disappointing. After a long movie it was not enough of a payoff. Otherwise, this is highly recommended.",1
1051,"Brilliant dialogue outshines cheesy special effects.: I've been waiting for this show on DVD since my first DVD player. The writing is superb, the tone is dark--as fond as I am of Star Trek, Blake's 7 makes Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise look like Barney and Friends.",1
1052,Excellent work!: I strongly recommend this album by Lenine. It's excellent! I did not know his work until recently. I was amazed with his style and repertoire. Don't miss it!,1

1054,"Worst customer service ever: When I bought this scanner, I loved it. It was everything I needed at the right price. Then I upgraded my computer to windows 7. Well, this scanner doesn't support it. More than 20 inquiries about whether a driver will be forthcoming have resulted in NO RESPONSE from Mustek. I do no believe they ever intend to update te drivers, leaving this scanner dead in the water for newer computers and now completely useless to me. I would never buy anything from Mustek ever again no matter how good it looks on paper.",0
1055,Good reference: This is a good reference in general and very handy for those irregular verbs on which I often draw a blank when conjugating. Also a good reference for brushing up on complex tenses. Great for getting over hurdles with the ever-popular congiuntivo.,1
1056,worthless piece of junk!: I wanted this tv so bad because of it's convenience and style that I purchased it and returned it 3 times to get a working one. Every one of them stopped functioning correctly after 8-10 days. The picture went fuzzy and only the sound could be heard. I went and upgraded to the same tv but the eddie bauer edition found at target for 50$ more and have had it over three months now with no problems. Don't waste your money on this worthless piece of junk!!!,0

1058,"Author should stick to writing about the 1911: My review on this one is going to be a bit more critical than most. This is probably one of the worst books on Glock pistols that I have read to date. The author is constantly comparing Glocks to 1911's, and other types of pistols. The book is also loaded with plenty of non-Glock images. Mr. Sweeney, I bought this book because I like the Glock, not because I wanted to see plenty of photos of 1911's... ad nauseam. Perhaps Mr. Sweeney should stick to books writing books like his ""Gun Digest Book of the 1911"", as he has done Glock more than a bit of injustice.You know, I recently purchased Massad Ayoob's excellent book ""The Gun Digest Book of Sig-Sauer"". Mr. Sweeney, please take note... Massad's book on the Sig is FILLED with useful information and photos related to his book's title... SIG-SAUER PISTOLS!Sorry, but I must recommend a pass on Sweeney's ""sort of Glock"" book!Hans",0

The book knocked my dating skills back so badly that I could not even score with my own hand after I read it. My advise is to keep far away from this book and if you have it, burn it quick.",0

1066,"Danger: Coffee Sludge: I was beside myself with joy when this arrived at my home; I'm a serious coffee-drinker and have been limping around on a 4-cup Mr Coffee for some time. For the price, I figured it would be like magic, but as it turns out it's just another Earthly appliance. My main beef with this product is that steam from the brewing process is trapped in the chamber with the super-finely ground coffee. The entire inside of the machine gets coated with a muddy coffee-sludge after just one use. Also, I find whole beans ""glued"" to the lid of the grinder, which is a tragic waste in my opinion.Aside from the goo, however, the coffee is delicious (I especially like the charcoal filter for the water reservoir - fancy!) and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for a nice long time without burning it up.",1
1067,"What CJ ""chris911"" said: For everyone that's saying ""it's for big hands."" I have very big hands, and I still find this very uncomfortable. The rubber elastic resistance makes it sluggish and akward. You only work it on the squeeze. And I don't feel like my pinky is getting a workout, either. I liked the 5 dollar ones that I have better. At lest they have a foam cushion that's comfy. I'm returning this garbage.",0
1068,"Very nice and unexpensive: For the price that I paid for it, this lense is the best zoom lense any Nikon photographer shold have. I picked this one (over 70-300mm Nikon lense) as it fully complimented my Nikon D50 with 18-55 lense. I was using it outside to make photos of my son swimming polo game and I couldn't understand what other reviewers were saying that this lense is slow at stopping an action. I was able to freeze actions of the game to each water splashes then the ball was flying and hitting the water surface. I am hightly recommending this lense.",1
1069,"The Best of the Bonds!: Years ago a friend had told me that ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was one of his favorite movies, not because he preferred George Lazenby over Sean Connery, but rather because the movie was so much like the book! I read the book and I'm inclined to agree with him.It's the second novel by Fleming to feature arch villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld of the Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Espionage, Revenge, Terror, and Extortion (SPECTRE). Just like ""THUNDERBALL"", Blofeld's got a clandestine scheme in the works that could ruin Great Britain and make him a rich, rich man. The British secret service has their best man on the case and 007 is going to have to rely on his sharp wits and resourcefulness if he's going to foil SPECTRE's plans.Of all the James Bond novels I've read, this one ranks as the best of the best! Nobody does it better than Ian Fleming. 5 STARS!",1
1070,"A one of it's kind handbook on how to say yes, to yourself!: Finally! A book about sexual power for survivors of sexual abuse. A far reaching, fun, and accessable look at sexual healing and reclaiming by a gentle and astute teacher. Staci Haines speaks from the soul of the issue, emphasizing self care and adventure. Most importantly, her reccomended exercises help you get the message into your muscles. Not just your head. Which is where too many of us have lived for too long. Brava to you, Staci. A must read for everyone, survivors or not.",1
1071,"This Little Piggy Drove Her Mommy Nuts: Olivia's darned cute. The illustrations are squeezable, if slightly sparse. Younger kids will enjoy the straighforward text that mirrors their own lives. Parents will snicker at the dry wit of the writing, especially when paired with the deadpan drawings. Skip this one if you prefer kid's books with enormous amounts of color, if you like drawings to be larger than life. Olivia's very unassuming. A perfect little pig.",1
1072,"Disappointing. Not even worth a rental: Sorry, this is a disappointment. Went out to buy it first thing. No Halo. Part of the problem is just feels to realistic. You keep shooting these robot like things and they don't fall down. Also, the concept is sort of stupid. The robots have weird faces, etc. It was just very disappointing.",0
1073,"Trash the Trash: I watched about fifteen minutes of this slapstick travesty and threw it in the trash. Really enjoyed Black Adder II. Having seen other episodes from other seasons that I liked, this was a surprise. Viewer, pay attention to other reviews. I didn't. I was warned. Do not rent or buy.",0
1074,"Great Cinematography: Planet Earth has to be one of the best Blu-Ray titles available today. The scenes are incredible! If you like animal/environmental documentaries, you will LOVE this series.My only complaint is that Sigourney Weaver is NOT the narrator as was the case when the series aired in the US Discovery Channel showing. Even though, the images are spectacular and compelling. I love it.",1
1075,"the absolute best, vivid: Jim Harrison is today's Hemmingway, better. He can create a portrait of beauty, depth, humor and love. His writing makes one want to taste, live, experience. He writes the essence of life!",1
1076,"Not adequate: Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all.",0
1077,NOT REAL GLASS: The door knob is not worth almost $70. The description claimed it is european cut crystal glass it isn't even glass! The handles are not as sturdy as I would like. After installing the door knob there was extra play in the knobs even after tightening the screws to the point where they almost were stripped. Disapointed in this product.,0
1078,absolute junk: sure the cord retracts but it doesn't stay *extracted*! The rubber 'cushion' around the earbud is also just a flimsy band. Yuck... waste-o-money.,0
1079,"Fun to use, terribly poor materials design.: My gf bought this product about 4 months ago. We thought it'd be an easy way to get exercise in front of the TV.I way about 190lbs and used the product about 3x/week.It completely failed when the u-bolt pushed completely through the center bar/pole. So I used the product ~50x and now it will be thrown in the trash, because it failed in a way that is beyond repair.Its just bad engineering as you can see that someone didn't calculate the force that would be applied to the backside of the center bar/pole.I liked the product, but found that its materials were of extremely poor/cheap quality. I will not buy any more Wagan Tech products.",0
1080,"Amazing soundtrack: This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. ""When She Loved Me"" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie, and paid any attention to the music at all, the soundtrack is a must. I put it in my CD player, sit back, and relax. I'll listen to this one for years to come.",1
1081,"Great camera!: This camera is awesome. There is a lot to learn about it, though. I love the lack of shutter delay. The pictures are incredible. Great camera for the price. I got the camera as a packagae with 2 lenses.",1
1082,Directed Verdict.......Spellbinding.......loved it: I cannot say enough about this book.....if there were 10 stars I would give it a 10...I was spellbound all the way through the book. Directed Verdict should be a must read if you like legal thrillers. Randy Singer is a great writer.,1
1083,"A heavy hammer with which to hit large nails: The thick green book is a reference for options professionals. It requires deep thought and carefull reading, almost like being back in college. As a bible, I would hardly recommend it for beginners, but it is suitable for the mathematically inclined eggheads that do not have software available. Nowdays, you can get programs that will do much of what this book explains at the push of a button. If you already have an options book, this is the advanced text and a classic on the shelves right now.",0

1087,Very disappointed due to the DVD being defective.: I purchased this movie because I had seen it several years ago and loved it. Got a little over half way through and found that the DVD is defective. Guess I'll have to go through all the hassle of returning and then reordering. I despise having to return something!!,0
1088,"Very Difficult: Although some claim it is classic, don't expect it to be readable. The book's definitions cna be quite confusing, and it is often difficult to understand many of the definitions or problems without a great deal of effort. If you are using this book for a class, I would reccomend getting a more readable text for reference.",0

1090,"An unworth sucessor to a great original: Danny Boyle reinvented the Zombie genre with ""28 Days Later"" but this sequel does a disservice to the original. The moment you realize the plot involves children-in-peril you know the story is headed in the wrong direction. Would the US government really allow children to settle in a highly dangerous compound? Well, maybe yes, but only in a movie that disregards plausibility. If security of the compound is so critical, would it be that easy for the children to escape the quarantine? This leads to one of the most incredible coincidences in movie history, followed by what can only be described as ""cinematic-stupids"" when the most dangerous prisoner in the compound is left unguarded. Its better to savour the original than watch this mess of a movie.",0
1091,"BOOOOOOORRING! OMG so boring!: I hate twighlight the movies, the books, but as far as all media is concerned this is definitely the most BOOORING movie in the series. 2 hours of wedding scenes and the two characters making kissy face or having a measuring contest among the vampire and chihuahua dude. TERRIBLE MOVIE",0

The crack seeps, I was really disappointed...usually I am all about EVERYTHING that Target sells, but this time I was a little bummed! It will now go on top of my kitchen cabinets with some pretty silk flowers or something...because I do think it is very pretty. (PS~ I was even really careful with it because I wanted to preserve it's look.)",0
1094,"Excellent!: This is a WONDERFUL cd of solo and chamber works by this composer. It's amazing how much great music there is out there waiting to be discovered. This guy's music is amazing. It really pulled me in and captivated me. It is approachable, with lots of excitement, but also tons of heart. I'm hooked! Highly recommended!",1
1095,"Too many typos: Seems like it might be an enjoyable book, but you can hardly read it for the typos. The word ""the"" is spelled ""lithe"" on the first page and there are two additional words with incorrect embedded hyphens. Clearly, somebody threw the Kindle edition together on the fly and didn't even bother to read the first page.Amazon: why do you let publishers get away with such lousy Kindle versinos? It's your platform, how about defending your users a little bit, OK?",0
1096,"Stopped working shortly after purchased: The Frother appears to be built well; I really liked the stainless steel construction. However, out of the box, it didn't work that well: would spin very slowly at first and then ramp up to a higher RPM. Once in the milk, it would bog down and stop spinning until I pulled it out again. I replaced the included batteries thinking they were bad, but it didn't help. Finally, after about five uses, it quit working all together. Maybe I got a lemon...",0
1097,"Interesting and informative: I saw Big Sky years ago on PBS and thought it was excellent. Depicting trappers doing business with the Native Americans. (i think Blackfeet) I just thought it was a good movie cause I like Kirk Douglas and Arthur Honeycutt. And the female in the movie, they called her Teal Eye, was beautiful. I will be adding this movie to my collection. Preferably DVD, and black & white is cool, it doesn't have to be in color for me. Seeing how they traded back then for pelts and hides was very interesting. I felt good knowing not everybody wanted to kill the Indians.",1

1099,"A great SF mystery novel: To me personally, Infinity Beach ranks with the best SF mystery novels ever written. This is a taut thriller that ranges from moments of quiet reflection to truly eerie horror. It is impossible to figure out what is going on until the truth is revealed and whether this is a red herring or a stunning revelation will be for you to find out. Mystery novels in the true detective-like sense of the term are rather rare in SF but McDevitt makes a habit of this. In a larger sense there are many SF novels that are mysteries but in a more unraveling, casual though no less intriguing way. I can think of some past greats: ""Beyond the Blue Event Horizon"" by Frederik Pohl, ""Ringworld"" by Larry Niven, ""The Mote In God's Eye"" by Niven and Jerry Pournelle. ""Infinity Beach"" ranks very high in my book.",1
1100,"Uplifting Christmas Movie: An enjoyable movie relating the importance of giving rather than receiving during Christmas, but adding the concern for service over the entire year. Our heroine learned how to see the need around her and respond with love to other people's needs. (Loved the powdery snow scene.)",1
1101,"I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby, when she is teaching him the cha-cha! I definatly recommend this movie to everybody. A time-less classic!",1
1102,"I expected more ideas and less complicated ones!: I bought this book last year when it was published so there were no customer reviews thenm, and i wish there were.I bought the book based on the title, i expected easy and fast projects which give creative and lovely results. While the book is wonderful to browse because of its excellent photography, the projects are FAR from being easy and ""instant gratification"".Most of the projects have a long list of needed supplies, and the ideas weren't the ""ah, why didn't I think of that"" kind either. I was particularly annoyed by the large number of projects that do not CREATE anything, but rather decorate a glass ornament. I can think of ways to spice up a glass ball, thank you very much.I do NOT recommend this book only as a viewbook for getting in christmas mood, but there are better books out there for that. I give it two stars for the photography and design, but for contents it doesn't deserve it.",0
1103,"Don't read at night!: I am new to Karen Rose, this is the second book of hers I have read. I have to admit that at first I was unsure if I wanted to finish this book. The first chapter opened with a sick and twisted crime. So heinous that I actually put this book down and opted for a lighter read. In the ""About the Author"" section of Ms. Rose's book, it says ""she enjoys making other people afraid to go to sleep"", and I will say she did that very well.I came back to this book and although it still creeped-me-out, I enjoyed how strong Tess Ciccotelli remained in the face of such evil when her world was falling apart. I also liked the love story within, the love of the main characters and also of family.",1
1104,Fish too sweet: The book is too saccharine and simplistic. I also had the pleasure of listening to the audio book as well. The condescending tone was annoying and I felt as if the approaches were unrealistic.The underlying principles were reasonably valuable but personally did not like the delivery.,0
1105,"Tip broke off in one year: The headphones sound great--no arguement there. However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke. The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck. Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times.",0
1106,"Eh: Got this phone because of its size. Opened the box and was immediately unsatisfied. The phone is cheaply made, the buttons are insanely small. And to top it off, unlike what I was told by various stores, this phone can not be used on AT&T, it doesnt accept the correct signals.",0
1107,"Lousy interface & low level of sophistication: Stay away from this item. I really feel like I've been rolled for the $35 I paid for this loser. It has all the things about MS software you love to hate: poor interfaces; nonintuitive ways of making things happen and a real lack of utility compared to what's possible as evidenced by MS' competitors. It feels as though this package has been cobbled together in a short period of time. And the folks who put this together CAN'T also use it, for if they did many of the really bad features would be fixed. I own a GPS, use Google Earth extensively and routinely travel long distances both in an RV and by car. This SW is almost useless to me. I'm going back to my old Rand McNally SW and will probably sell this dog on ebay.",0
1108,"Disappointed this did not hold dogs urine.: I bought this diaper wrap for my elder 15 year old border collie mix who suddenly hasn't been able to ""hold it"" through the night. The diaper wrap with a sanitary pad just could not hold the volume of urine my 27 lb. dog produced. By 6AM both the diaper wrap, the additional sanitary pad, along with the floor and the dog were thoroughly soaked with urine. I'd rather use a wee-wee pad on the floor and clean up the mess each morning than have my dogs fur soaking in her urine all night long and then have to bathe her, wash the diaper and wash the floor. Ugh! So very disappointed with the lack of absorbency, I threw it in the trash.",0

It has a very small area to catch the dripping water from the brush and air will not dry the area and the brush good after useing. The brush is better, but not by much.",0

1112,"Clutch: So I finally bought this cd, and i have to say, the first few times i listened to it i was a bit disappointed. I realize now however that some disappointment is an inevitable outcome of listening to a new clutch album in the context of their other stuff, for every clutch album is unique unto itself. It took some getting used to, but i now appreciate this album for its own worth, and it is actually quite good. and in the context of 99% of what passes as ""music"" these days, its excellent. red horse rainbow is quite the catchy tune, and have a look at the lyrics for that, where in all holy hell do they come up with their lyrics..ahh i digress..

I would say the only negative is the gnawhides are not available at any local pet stores so we always have to order them on Amazon. The Everlasting treat (another long lasting treat)is easier to find, but the dogs (especially the puppy) seem to like the busy bone better. I usually put one treat on at a time to make the treats last longer.",1
1116,"A bit of mystery, but NOT a thriller: I didn't care much for this book and I am a fan of James Patterson. I didn't like any of the characters, especially the grandad Mack, who was supposed to be so ""good"". He was irritating. The ""trial"" was implausible and it's result just made glad the book was over. Why was nobody angry at the character Sammy who was one of the childhood circle of friends? I never felt drawn into life at the Hamptons and wondered why it was set there and not in Bevery Hills or some other rich people's town. I only hope that the disapointment with this book that I and others felt is due to the writing partnership here, no offense to Peter De Jonge. Mr. Patterson has a definite style (Alex Cross novels) and we need to see that shine through, please.",0

1120,"Great if you live in Los Angeles, otherwise don't bother!: I was very disappointed in this book.If you live in Los Angeles, I would recommend this book, otherwise forget it. Many of the most unusual jobs were related to the movie and television industry and thus only available in LA, or perhaps New York. Others you could probably only find if you lived in a very (and I do mean very) large city. As for the rest of the jobs, the majority of them can be seen in the want ad columns everyday.Almost all of her source information recommended checking in the yellow pages under the desired field. When there were actual phone numbers again they were usually for Los Angeles or other large cities.While there were a few ideas I found interesting I think this book would have been better titled: '50 run of the mills jobs that you've already seen in the want ads, 24 interesting ideas, 20 more interesting ideas if you live in a very large city, and 60 really cool ideas if you happen to live in Los Angeles.'",0

The product isn't actually designed specifically for the psp, it is a generic cellphone charger that works with the psp. The charger quickly overheats and feels very flimsy. While pulling the charger out of the socket about a week after purchasing the case simply fell apart. Overall I would only recomend this as an emergency charger until you can find or afford a real one.",0
1125,"Good information, TERRIBLE layout: I would have LOVED to give this book a better review, but unfortunately it suffers from two things:1. Numerous typographical errors, which are unacceptable and distracting2. A disjointed layout that might have been designed to appeal to a short-attention spanned teen through bold page shifts and font changes, but comes off as disruptive and annoyingI heard Pam Stenzel speak on a radio show and was completely enthralled by the information she shared and the way that she spoke. Although my daughter is only four, I ordered this book immediately with the thought that I would read it and share it someday. Although there is some great information in the book, it is so poorly constructed both physically and in layout that I doubt it will survive until my daughter is old enough to understand it. The book needs a serious editorial, layout, and publishing upgrade. In the current state it is a challenge even to the patient reader.",0
1126,"A TALENTED YOUNG BLACK AND GIFTED MAN!!!!: There aren't enough words that can express R. Kelly's talent. The creator ""THE LORD"" blessed him with the max. When I hear he has a new album without even listening to it, I know it will be the bomb.. He is talented just like ""Babyface"" They both sing from the heart and not from words written just on paper.Without them there is no telling where that kind of music would be these days!!!God Bless Them Both!!!Keep it up...",1
1127,"Crap. I'm very disappointed by this album.: At least I got it as a gift from a friend. The only salvageable tracks are ""Baby"", and ""Down on the corner"". The rest is another cover: ""In Between Days"" by the Cure, and filler material. This is their third album since their breakup and reunion, their first two being ""Me mata la vida"" and ""10,000Km"",;disappointing albums. Their best efforts are the first five CDs: Rosas Rojas (''89), Escenas de la vida amorosa ('91), Devorador de corazones ('93), Huija ('95) and their first live album, hopelessly out of print and rare: La Portuaria En vivo ('96). Their return in 2001 with ""Me Mata La vida"" was an exercise in hype, egos and futility. The well ran dry. Though they did sell CDs and a couple of hit singles came emerged, the material on their albums since then has been forgettable. Try to find the first 5 CDs I pointed out, or go for a greatest hits compilation. Either way you'll enjoy this band at their prime. Right now, they are all coasting downhill.",0

This absolutely completes any Too Much Joy fan's collection, and gives a real insight into how far Joy has come over the years -- as is evidenced by the new tracks that are included on this disc.

Plus, who can ever forget ""The Otter Song,"" or switching the speaker balance back and forth for ""Don Quixote"" to see what's being mumbled during the chorus . . .",1

My ear was fine with using H2ocean for about two months before it got infected. I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month. Despite warning against using alcohol on the area, I finally decided to just switch to using an alcohol-based toner solution that cleared up my infection within a week! H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn't really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean! The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer. Good luck!",0

This is in fact NOT the soundtrack. It is a compilation of some tracks from various horror movies (like Halloween). Not bad...but all very slow and monotonous. And the 2nd CD is in fact a DVD.

I had it installed in the trunk of a central heating unit (very close to the main blower) to control some booster fans. As it turned out, the several booster fans were so powerful that they sucked the air faster than the main blower could push it; As soon as the booster fans came on they created negative-pressure in the duct, so the pressure switch would turn off. Then the positive pressure from the main blower would turn it back on again (on, off, on, off, and so on). I wound up abandoning the pressure switch and just having the boosters wired directly with the main blower. It would have been nice if the pressure/sensitivity was adjustable, but the product does work as designed so I can't complain.",1

I can't help but notice that the ones who gave this TV a positive review have owned it for much less time than those who gave it a negative one.

1193,"Disappointing: GOSSIP GIRL just wasn't my cup of tea. It's pretty graphic with the language, sex, and drug use, but the real horror of the novel is the poor writing. The characters are largely flat and unlikable, and the story doesn't really go anywhere. There are some flashes of wit, but the novel mostly consists of cliches and situations you would find in any soap opera.If you're mature enough to handle the adult themes in this novel, why not graduate directly to novelists like Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, or Jackie Collins? In my opinion, their books are just as sexy, but are far better written and feature much more interesting characters.",0

Finding this CD was exciting for us!While the music is enjoyable, it may not feature the same performers as the original group.

Thank God Paul was not right-minded but was Christ minded. John Pollock does a fantastic job of filling in the gaps for me. His description of the towns, roadways, scenery and culture are very helpful as I read Paul's letters.One of the ideas the author suggests is that Paul may have been married with a child. He then goes on to tell what might have happened and how this shaped his writings on marriage and his relationship to his spiritual son Timothy. There are many other ideas that are just as intriguing that the author writes about.I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading others by Mr. Pollock.The Apostle: A Life of Paul",1

It cost a tiny fraction of ""Eagle"" and contains no international stars (Leslie Banks is its biggest name), but it's ten times more moving, more suspenseful, and more genuinely atmospheric, and its characters -- young and old, upper class to yeoman to poacher, and particularly its women, many of them quietly heroic -- are far more vivid and memorable.",1

I used the aforementioned Cranial Expansion Kit to enlarge my head making installing these babies a snap. I won't lie though, even with an expanded cranium I can feel the cables pressing down on my optic nerve. But let's be honest, who needs to see light when you can hear the movement of the spheres. If you don't already have these you aren't really living. You are more of a mewling fetus, helpless and pink, squirming across the surface of your mother straining to find nourishment.

I read another review that said she just turned hers so it faces the other direction for un-heeled shoes and the shoes butt up against the wall. Makes sense to me! As I was aware that they were for heeled shoes and that's what I wanted, I would definitely recommend this purchase.",1
1204,"Gregory has done better: I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I. Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship. And the writing isn't so hot, either. If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad. The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort.",0

You can adjust the top to get the desired size of pepper you wish. This is my third one I have purchased. One of them froze up and I think it was my fault as I would turn it over when cooking and the steam ruined it. My new one works great except the bottom doesn't want to stay on very good and it makes the batteries clunk if it is not on tight. I am afraid that will strip the gears. I took the bottom off the old one before I threw it away and now it works better. When my friends saw mine, they purchased this grinder as well.",1
1209,"A great read that was too short.: This was a thrilling book that was a page turner - non stop action, great humor, loveable characters, and it leaves you wanting more. My favorite Dean Koontz novel, better than Watchers. Even more so than Watchers, I want a sequel, or better yet, several sequels. The interaction between Tommy and Del is electric, and I hope that as Del gets on with her real work, we can share in Tommy and Del's adventures. Light hearted but with some real lessons to be gleaned, this story makes you wish there really was magic in the world",1

I played the CD in my car for a week or so, and ya know what? I don't care who the band is, or what their sound should be, its a damn good CD. It just is.'Love and Memories' is probably going to be huge. And even though it's not 'O.A.R's sound' its okay. Most of the CD is. Is it over produced? I think so. But it could be worse. And if you're looking for the most ""O.A.R."" songs, they are definitely 'Wonderful Day' and 'One Shot'.Also, no one else has mentioned that 'Dakota' is about John Lennon. I mean, seriously people, how has no one written about this yet?",1

WTF?!? If This DVD was jam packed with extra and DYNASTY: THE REUNION, it would almost be understandable. But I gurantee it is not. It's just a greedy, corporate gimmick, designed to screw the fans- and totally screw up how our collection looks!!!! DYNASTY could learn from how DALLAS is realeased. Bam. Bam.

I used the shampoo and conditioner every day and the bottles lasted me about two months. I was skeptical at first, but it was hard to deny that this actually worked, since I could see it right before my eyes. Every night, I would shower and shampoo like normal, but making sure to massage the product more carefully into my scalp. Same with the conditioner. I massaged it into my scalp, left it on for about 3 minutes, used a wide-tooth comb to evenly distribute the product, and then rinsed it out. However, I bought this product for a friend who had colored hair (natural brunette, gone purple) who said that this really stripped the purple out of her hair.

If David Fincher would have directed this (not because he's my favorite director or anything; this is just his kind of movie cause he did such a great job with the dark atmosphere of ""Seven""), this could have been one great movie! Lousy Schumacher... he outta stick to his John Grisham novels and leave the cool things alone cause all he does is ruin them. The film is disturbing and it's a little effective cause you feel so sorry for the girl and her mom, but it's just lacking a story and just drags on. A good movie to rent, but if you wanna buy it, wait till the price drops a little. Lousy Schumacher...",0

The activities are match the mark to the pony, colouring, connect-the-dots, and match the ponies. The purse is really cute and well-made, and it has plastic hollow handles.

'The Philadelphia Story' is fantastic, particularly with Cary Grant & Jimmy Stewart in co-starring roles. 'Little Women' is wonderful. 'Dragon Seed' is the reason we bought this set. We had been looking for a copy for several years. As astounding as it seems, Hepburn stars a Chinese woman as Japan invades in WW2, and, we thought, does very well in the role. Highly recommended if you like old movies, even if you are not a Hepburn fan.",1

The way the book is presented would probably be ideal for a student of network dynamics, or even a mathmetician. For an average reader like myself, it is far too detailed and laborious. There is very little entertainment value in the discussions that surround the occasional revelations. My suggestion: Read the abbridged version.",0

I'm a little partial to French after taking two terms of it in college. If you, like me, were discouraged with French music because of the concept album of Les Miserables, don't worry about it. Romeo et Juliette is much easier to understand and translate. And DO translate it! The lyrics are some of the most poetic I've ever heard. While I wish it could be found in English so my family and friends could get as much out of it as I do, there's just nothing that equals Frere Laurent's agonizing ""Mais l'encre des Evangiles dans mon couer est seche"" (""The ink of the Apostles is dried on my heart"") in French. It just isn't the same in English. Neither is ""Pour nous, la vie est facile, mais le bonheur est fragile"" (For us life is easy, but our happiness is fragile""). French musicals are movin' on up!",1

Dr. Fernandez points out why anxiety, depression, and anger cannot be ignored any longer when trying to figure out a person's pain and medical illness. He goes through great depths to explain exactly how emotions can interact with physical problems -- and it's not just about simple cause and effect but much more. Importantly, he provides options for the treatment and assessment of these problems, and I feel confident about these because they are backed up with scientific evidence. It is reassuring to know that the conclusions in the book are supported up by extensive research in the field.",1

1252,"Mixed Blessing: While the editors have greatly added to the ease of picking up more vocabulary than is learned in Mounce's course, there are two major drawbacks to this Greek New Testatment. First, is the use of a somewhat italic Greek font that results in some characters differing considerably from other Greek fonts. In particular are the characters for rho (which looks like an omicron with some form of subscript) and the kappa which looks like a lower case English ""x""). The second, and more critical drawback, is that this is a reverse engineered text based on the selections made by the NIV translation committee (per the editors description in the introduction).At least the latter of these should be made clear in the book's description and the editors should certainly consider a more standard font in future editions.It's not that I will pitch this volume out, it is that I wish it could have been better than it is.",0

If they fix the software, this could be a good product, but right now my recommendation is: AVOID.Things they need to fix with the backup software:- make it usably fast (the UI itself and the backup speed - for large numbers of small files)- make it reliable!

1267,"Dissapointing!: I found The Comfort of Strangers to be dissapointing. At points the use of symbolism by the writer was so blatent it became mundane. For example when Colin and Mary first meet Robert they notice he is wearing a tiny razor blade around his neck. Many events in the plot were left frustratingly unexplained, instead of creating mystery, they cause the story to become unbelievable. One of these such instances is when Colin and Mary see Caroline waving to them on the balcony, although reluctant, they go to visit her. The author offers little more than a vague explanation for this fatal mistake. However although the plot is lacking and tends to lag in areas, the writing does have flashes of brillance. My favourite part in the novel is when Robert describes the ritualitic way his father groomed himself. Ultimately, I think the issues that The Comfort of Strangers raises, are far more interesting to ponder than the book is to read.",0

I can walk my dog and push the stroller one-handed. My son loves this stroller, even though there is no tray. Yes, it doesn't have all the bells & whistles - no basket, no cup holder, no tray, and the canopy is kindof a joke - my son just reaches up and pushes it away if I use it - plus it often pops off when I fold the stroller. Oh and speaking of folding the stroller, it takes 2 people and an act of God to close this darn thing! BUT - it's so light and small, I just pop it in the back of my car - folded up still!

The book covers different things regarding the government and big business and their role in the current problems with the drugs on the market at this time.There are many common sense natural cures, many people opt out of to use for the convenience of a pill.

Now, we're told we should make poopie jokes with our kids and laugh right along. ""But kids laugh at this stuff anyway, so what's the harm? Don't be such a stick in the mud!""

1282,"Music To Discover: This CD marks the premiere recording of Dohnanyi's Second Symphony. I find it odd that it has never been recorded, as it is a tuneful and engaging symphony. The music has a romanticism that is closer to the German tradition than Dohnanyi's Hungarian contemporaries: Bartok and Kodaly. The Second Symphony was written during the Second World War, but reflects none of the cataclysmic horrors of the war. The mood is overall somber and lyrical with a short scherzo that is a circus-like parody. It ends triumphantly in a movement of theme and variations.The Symphonic Minutes of 1933 is a pure delight consisting of five short movements: Capriccio, Rhapsodia, Scherzo, Thema con Variazione and Rondo. It is a charming, uplifting piece, a great concert opener. This CD provides a good introduction to Dohnanyi's music and is highly recommended.",1

1284,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT: I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it. However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers. I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job. This is not what you want. Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)",0
1285,"Fooled by Taleb: Slipshod thinking and appalling writing from a preening egoamaniac with a fat wallet. Of course, the great irony is that, for all Taleb's admonitions to beware survivor bias, this would never have been published if he himself had been unsuccessful in his trading.The author confesses in the first few pages that he did no research specifically for the book, and relied entirely on memory -- and it shows whenever he writes about anything not autobiographical. Even then! Maybe this is a fictional memoir of a repulsive, unreliable narrator, a Nabokovian game? Taleb does claim to be a ""connoisseur"" of literature. The joke's on us, I think.",0
1286,"Mountain ""Mach Two"": This was a big disappointment. I wish I could believe that it was an off night, but it looks to me like they did not even rehearse for this gig. Spinal Tap's ""Free Form Jazz Odyssey"" sounded better than parts of this DVD. The transitions between the songs are sloppy and fumbling, West keeps fiddling with his settings on his guitar which he seemed to have problems with. This is probably a matter of taste, but I didn't like Richie Scarlett's bass playing on most of the set. The great Mountain comes off like a bar band not the great powerhouse that they once were.That being said, Leslie is in fine voice on the set and he can still scratch out some sparks. I wish he would go back to his signature sound though. He has mucked it up quite a bit.The real crime here is that the group put this thing out. It's a sub par product, that will probably only be watched once by Mountain fans (of which I am one). Have some respect for your fans and rehearse.",0
1287,"Even at $3 this is not a good deal: I read many of the reviews before purchasing and decided to buy it even though I knew I was going to have to do some out-of-the-box maintenance to make it work. But I figured a powerful light for $3 isn't bad. Sure enough it didn't work right out-of-the-box, but after sanding the paint off the threads I got it to work. The disappointment is that this light with its 9 LEDs and 3 AAAs is not as bright as my itty bitty Leatherman Monarch 300 with its 1 LED and 1 AAA. Sure the Leatherman costs more but there's an old saying, ""You get what you pay for.""",0

It also includes great information with regards to individual samurai and how their previous experience may have influenced the battle outcome. The information from this book alone is worth the buy. You can hardly find any book as such outside Japan. However, the only fuss I have is that the book could have been published with better binding or include a hardcover edition. The binding is so bad that you might ruined the book in the process of trying to get a better view of its contents. Other than that, it's a book that must not be missed by students of Sengoku Jidai.",1

The color on this phone is nothing to brag about and the camera does not take clear pictures at all. For anyone thinking of buying this phone don't waste your money. I would suggest going with a samsung. They seem to get the best reception and have the best color. Don't waste your money on this phone, you'll be disappointed. I know I am!",0
1295,Big difference in son's playing: Went with my 10 year old son's band teacher to a music store to pick up a new mouthpiece for his beginner sax at music teachers insistence. Son tried about 8 different mouthpieces and there was a huge improvement in sound and his ability to hit different notes with this mouthpiece. Everyone is different and this particular mouthpiece was well suited for my son's mouth shape/style or i think they call it embouchure. The price was $175 at the music store but his teacher got a discount so i think we paid about $130 for it.,1

He was skeptical and as he was a hardheaded type he went on for a while I finally asked if he wanted to try this or keep hurting.

It comes with a guide to use the book effectively, and is divided into sections of special topics. Each section contains a Native American story, discussion ideas, interesting questions, and related indoor and outdoor activities. These activities can be accomplished without expensive materials, often in or near the home or school. Oh, by the way, adults will learn from this book also!",1
1300,"FEAR EVERYTHING: I thought that this was a wonderful book. It takes your imagination beyond normal limits and then brings you back. The characters are great and really share a bond that obviously can not be broken, including the dog. It mixes a little bit of sci-fi with surfer and that is an interesting mix. In the setting of Moonlight Bay you can not trust anyone and you never know where trouble is going to show its pretty little face. You must be very cautious, trust nobody, and fear everything. I couldn't put it down and have really enjoyed reading it. In my opinion, Dean Koontz is an excellent writer and should never stop what he is doing. I hope that he comes out with more books like this.",1

The initial chapters give a very clear description of the various atmospheric effects such as refraction and attenuation. This is fully supported by the relevant equations describing these effects and where appropriate descriptions of the atmospheric conditions giving rise to the phenomena being described. The reader will also appreciate the extensive use of real data to illustrate the atmospheric effects described throughout this book.

The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace.",0

Trying not to laugh out loud on a darkened international flight while fellow passengers were sleeping was near impossible. This book is fun and is written with intelligence and great humor. Yet it still manages to address some real issues that women should take note of, from asking for raises, negotiating better salaries at job interviews, to breaking off relationships cleanly and maintaining a body weight that's equal to your IQ-Right On Sister! Her advice though written through the heavy veil of humor, I found to be real, thought provoking and sensible. Unlike her memoir, Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress, which was very much a ""chick read"", I think men who are comfortable with themselves, love women, have a good sense of humor and don't take themselves too seriously will enjoy this book too. It's just plain funny.",1

Once you have those, you're guranteed a great level. The later levels, especially Hornburg Courtyard, and near impossible without those and the Rising Attack. The extras in the game are great.

Yes, that woman is her ""definition of a Messiah.""

That isn't to say that it isn't worthy of the unparalleled William Shakespeare, but you may want to take the general tone of the book into account. I will say that the play is very unique and very interesting when the substance of the plot comes through. As with anything by Shakespeare, this is ultimately worth getting.",1

The character of Belinda no longer has red hair and is no longer fiesty. The new Belinda is too stoic and barely smiles in the entire movie. Cloris Leachman does a great job as the orphanage matron, but she cant save the movie. Even Haylie Duff does a decent job as Belinda's classmate. Lou Diamond Phillips and Patrick Duffy were horrible too. The book is so much better: Belinda is not married, and follows Mrs. Stafford-Smythe (from the previous movie) to Boston to be her private nurse. I hope the next movie is better!",0
1317,This the best photogear item I currenlty own.: This is an increadible piece of photohardware. The build is a such that it can be used for construction work raising bricks to the upper floor !I attached my Genesis 400 light to the arm and it felt like nothing was attached at all. I even did not have to use a counterbalance for it. If you want something sturdy that can be used in the most demanding application look no further this is the one you will ever need. But if the only thing you want to use it for is a speedlight you may consider some ligher and less sturdy alternative.On the dark side the stand in relatively large when closed and heavy. It is not air cusioned but it feels 'spingy' when fully closed so the light will not slam down if the stand accidentally closes.,1

1328,"Good solid guide through Acts: I've been reading Acts in Greek. I often consult my 8 commentaries on Acts: Barrett's 2 volume ICC, Bruce's 3rd ed. Greek text commentary, Bruce's English NICNT, Fitzmyer's Anchor Bible commentary, Witherington's commentary, Bock's BECNT, Williams' NIBC, and this commentary by Marshall in the Tyndale series. Despite it's size and the scope of the series it is in, Marshall's commentary holds it's own with these others, much larger commentaries. It may be a bit dated in terms of interacting with scholars who have written since 1980, but it still gives a solid presentation of the historical, linguistic, and cultural aspects of Acts. It is well written and very easy to use.If you want to do serious study on Acts, you would need more than just this commentary. However, if you are not a scholar but are a pastor, a casual reader of Acts, or you are leading a small Bible study group, you will find this to be a great commentary on Acts.",1

""She Freak"" has been restored in clear detail and colors and you can see for yourself that Friedman blatantly ripped off Tod Browning's 1931 masterpiece, ""Freaks."" The movie starts out with promise, giving us glimpses of a real-life carnival, circa l967. But after awhile, it becomes boring. There's no skin shown, no soft-core sex, no violence and no suspense.

I have been using an ovulation calculator and keeping a journal of my cycles so hopefully we will conceive soon, even without the strips. If not, I will be buying a more reputable brand.",0

I have not experience the ""decaffinated"" effects of this tea, although the words do carry a placebo effect.I have found tea package in America/Canada from Twining do not have same quality as the Twining sold in England:London/Heathrow Airports. Just not the same in terms of the flavour. Very deceiving as it does not indicate on the website as where it has been packaged.",0

1354,"Dr. Paul Farmer, the Mother Teresa of Medicine: What an excellent reminder that The Only Real Nation is Humanity. Through this writing, author Tracy Kidder introduced me to Dr. Paul Farmer, who co-founded Partners-in-Health ([...]), an organization I now proudly support for their medical/humanitarian work in Haiti and elsewhere. Dr. Paul Farmer puts the 'care' in the medical care model. The feats he goes through just to get to his patients and check on them is way beyond remarkable. The book, though a non-fiction biographical work, is written like a literary piece and as a result, I could not put it down nor did I want to put it down. Who among us ever forgets someone, whose life (not their words) inspires us from the depths of our being? I oftentimes forget the inspirational words people declare, but rarely do I forget the inspirational things they do.",1

1358,"EXCELLENT! Well worth the money!!: I recently purchased these headphones and have used them quite often. I even use them just in my apartment! I took them on a recent trip to NYC and used them in the airport to drain out the low frequency noise in the airports and on the planes. It is just amazing how they work! I have always been a huge fan of Sony and this product just goes to show that Sony is the best out there!!The only thing I didn't like was that after a few hours of having them on they kind of hurt my ears. They just press a little to hard against your head. But that is a minor detail for the excellent product!!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anyone!!",1

1363,Fabulous book for classic dishes: Every recipe in this book is a proven winner (literally) -- I enjoy reading the process of the testing process to determine the absolutely best way to prepare every dish almost as much as eating the finished product. Find everything from an incredibly savory beef stew (we've made it three times already and continue to get rave reviews) to snickerdoodles and layered cakes. Everything that I've made so far has been the best that I've ever had. The emphasis is on homestyle foods -- no fancy ethnic dishes. One nice thing is that few of the dishes require fancy spices or things that you normally wouldn't buy. My favorite cookbook at the moment -- you can't go wrong with this one.,1
1364,"This is an abridged synopsis of the actual book: I have an older original version of this Dumas novel, that is 534 pages! It starts where Joseph Balsomo leaves off, with 'The field of the Dead'.

I have learned to seek out the older copies of Dumas, they are much more complete and original.",0

We just weren't given very much information until the end and at that point I was simply glad to be through it. I usually can't put a book of his down - this one was put aside for days. I was disappointed in Dean for what I felt was ripping off Watchers, and when it became so blatant that he was doing exactly that , he just tried to explain it away.",0

(That is, besides Dorothy Parker, who said in her New Yorker review, ""Constant Reader fwoed up,"" or something very like it.) Since about the 1970s, most editions have used the Disney illustrations, which I have never liked. This edition uses Shepard's original illustrations (one of my favorite things about the books), which I think is a great plus. However, they are colorized, also a plus for today's children, who have not needed to acquire the imagination to appreciate black and white drawings. All in all, a delightful edition.",1

1374,"Shallow and unconvincing to anyone well read: This book will convince only those who are already Christians who would never question their faith- no matter what, or those who are intellectual lightweights. The author does not make any pretense of having rigorously searched for the truth before arriving at his foregone conclusions. Rather, he ignores biblical and historical scholarship in blind devotion to his one-sided preconceived conlusions. If anyone wants to examine whether the bible really is the inerrant word of God, I recommend reading ""THE FIVE GOSPELS-WHAT DID JESUS REALLY SAY"" by Robert Funk, Roy Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar.",0
1375,"Decorative 40"" Dragon Bokken: This wooden practice sword looks very nice. Golden dragon decorations stand out on the dark wooden blade. Although not pictured (at this time), a guard and holding ring are included. I found both to fit too loosely to be of much use so left them off. Bokken still looks great. It would be nice if a decorative metal guard could be found for this practice sword. Something of that nature would really complete the look of this blade. It should be noted - the item picture shown above depicts the handle wraped in black cord. Mine came with a sort of beige-khaki shooelace wrap. Possibly something to consider before purchasing. (Still looks fairly nice)",1

Having tried the recipes that came with the george foreman grill and finding them excellent, I decided to invest in a whole george forman cookbook.The marinades are excellent! Many have few ingredients and maximum taste. While they are helpful if you have the grill they are excellent even if you don't. Marinades are a wonderful way to grill, in general. Some of them lend themselves even to panfrying, depending on the cut of meat or poulty. While you cant use bone-in meats in the GF grill, you can use these recipes with bone-in cuts and use an alternate cooking method (grilling, broiling or baking for chicken).This was a big surprize! At first I thought it was going to gimick-y and just a cookbook capitalizing on the GF name. But it is a *study* cookbook in its own right. excellent.",1

It's easy to learn to use (as far as video adjustments like horizontal/vertical and pincushioning), displays colors really well, and is easy to get drivers for. I tend to update my drivers once every 6 months or so since there seems to always be a newer one available. I run Win2K with a Voodoo 3 video card. It's a more than adequate monitor at the cheap end of the spectrum. I paid $250, but nowadays you shouldn't pay more than $150 for a new one.",1

I bought this with the idea that I would make it a little easier on my patients, without them having to feel that tight grip around their arm. Well, there is a reason for that tight grip,you get an accurate reading that way. I had all the best intentions in buying this product. But it's readings are just plain inaccurate. If you suffer from hypertension(high blood pressure) this product could be dangerous, as it may not be truelly letting you know that your blood pressure has elevated. It runs way below what a true blood pressure runs. Omron makes great products, I would recommend one of their arm cuff blood pressure machines, you will get a much more accurate reading. Hope it is helpful.",0

1385,"DECEMBER - always beautiful, now even better!!: I'll admit I'm biased - I love all of George's CDs. But I have to say that for overall listening, December flows the best. The classics are all still here - Carol of the Bells, the Kanon, and my favorite, the Holly and the Ivy.But the bonus tracks are interesting. A Christmas Song is simple and short. Sleep Baby Mine by Alfred Burt (who also composed Some Children See Him) is a very lovely song and fits in with the rest of the CD perfectly.What I bought the CD for, however, was the sheet music. It's about time!! Just glancing over it, George's version of the Kanon looks complicated, but not impossible. Probably intermediate to advanced.If you want to start listening to George Winston, start with this CD! Then try Plains.",1

The 89/90 is wonderfully done. Coincidentally, the America's Game version was on right after I saw this & I personally preferred the original. Each had it's own glossovers, but the vhs actually had more depth.Of all the seasons, I enjoy this one alot. The most powerful offense of all-time & yes the Niners steamrolled everyone in 89, but there were some notable storylines & changes.

Having hear the music on this CD I went to see this incredible coming of age musical in New York. Set in 1890 Germany, Spring Awakenings is based on a play written in this same period. It is remarkable that a 1890 playwrite would have been so ahead of his time to write a story about the supression human sexuality in teens and the harm it can do. The Original Cast recording is one after another passionate, funny and heartfelt songs. There is not one bad track on the album.",1

There is something very British about his self-effacing biography because in that country, you're born into a class, traditions, schools, social standing, region, accent etc. It's always a bit nauseating to read endless American & Canadian biographies with the same ""rags to riches"" smarminess.

1407,"Poor Man's Douglas Adams: I am a big fan of the late Douglas Adams, and have enjoyed the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ""trilogy"" as well as his Dirk Gently books, mostly because of his crazily funny sense of dry humor and wit. The big difference between those books and this one by Tom Holt (and I won't generalize my comments to Holt, since I've only read this book of his, but likely won't read the others because of this one) is that Adams balanced the silliness with entertaining dialog and description, whereas Holt uses a sledgehammer to bang you over the head, line after line, paragraph after paragraph, with the same kind of silliness that Adams used less liberally to greater effect.I give it two stars, rather than one, because it is clearly an homage to Adams (with references sprinkled about to Hitchhikers text which, I assume and hope, are there for the sake of mimicry rather than plagiarism), and hey, I can appreciate a good tribute.",0

1413,"Men may be from Mars, but we know what we do to them...: All Night Long is one heart-thumping, passionate read! It is definitely not for the faint of heart. Nor is ANL the type of book for those that are offended by straight forward talk about sex and the feelings that arise from wanting someone in a goooooood kind of way. Ms. Jerott delivers characters that are able to stand on their own, and offers supporting characters that don't get in the way of the story but instead add to it's spice and build. Annie and Rik are HOT! The feelings that the writer shows them expressing for one another are right on the money. There is nothing watered down here. It is exciting to know the thoughts that go through the mind of a man like Rik, whether about Annie's clothing, her perfume, her movements... It allows the readers to do a little experimenting of their own to see what kind of reaction will be gained. Men may be from Mars, but Ms. Jerott shows us what our actions really do to them!",1

After a whole book of seeing mostly flaws in Seth, along with ""God-like"" qualities in Roman, we are asked to believe that Seth is the winner of the feisty, brainy, beautiful Georgina, who could have any man.

As far as we can tell, you have to master the challenges or else you go back to where you were in the story to do it over and over again. Not too fun.The graphics are really great though and the story is cute. I'm sure this is a great game for some people, but it just wasn't for us. We'll stick to the Carnival game and the racing ones for him. We just picked up the Bully game, too, and that one seems a little challenging but not nearly as hard to navigate with the controls.",0

1425,"Caleb's mom: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I bought this pump since it seemed to have good reviews and the price was right. I should of spent the extra money and bought a Medula. When I first used it I loved the pump. Then after only 3 weeks the pump lost suction, I called the company they told me to boil the breast shield and it should work, it did for that day. The next day I boiled the shield and it did not make a difference I still had no suction and the motor was working fine. Of course it was a saturday and the customer service office was closed. Since I soley express and bottle feed I had to go buy another pump because they dont sell replacement shields in the store. Called the 1/800 number on Monday, they said they would ship new breast shield out immediatly, that was two weeks ago. I have called three times inquiring about the replacement shield and all they tell me is that i should receive it any day. After buying two pumps I could have bought the Medula.",0

It is a feast for the eyes, laying out sketches and illustrations that are unmatched anywhere else.As a Professional Army Officer and historian, this book also lays out, in detail, the very essence of the French Army during these times.This book runs the gauntlet from being a coffee table book, to a real resource for true military historians.",1

1428,"MANDATORY for teachers of HUCK: As a high school teacher in NYC I never attempted Huck without first having the students read from this book. The essays are (largely) insightful and cogent in their arguments pro and con. The places where logic is faulty or Huck is poorly quoted to serve a political end are transparent, giving students a wonderful chance to flex their logic-muscles and make their own opinions about Twain's text. It is an invaluable resource and a very, very important book.",1

1433,"Pasting: This book is not great for making xerox copies if you want to use it for a lot of kids. Because it is colored, the copies come out dark. Also, the cut out portions are small, and hard for the smaller kids. There are cute concepts though but not that practical to building scissoring skills.",0
1434,"excellent for students preparing to work with adolescents: Used as a textbook in my course in Adolescent Counseling, I had appreciative comments from my students who found the text not only informative, but easy to follow along in reading it. The book flows in a logical sequence and holds the reader's interest. It captures the essence of the developing adolescent and explains the normal process of maturation. The book also includes an extensive focus on what Miller Newton refers to as ""developmental traps,"" namely the interferences to normal development such as drug/alcohol abuse, violence, eating disorders, etc. He also includes relevant references at the end of each chapter to refer the reader to further works. As a professor, I found the text to be valued by the students and I value their opinions.",1
1435,"Boring, I could not get through it.: We choose this book for our January book club and of the 15 members most did not get more than half way through it before giving up.

1440,"Not correct part: The Amazon system of making sure you are ordering the correct part for the car has ALWAYS worked for me. This time it did not. It was obvious upon putting the cap even close to the distributer, that it would not fit. When I purchased the correct one from the Honda dealer, they were obviously very different. I was also distressed to learn that OEM were the initials of a manufacturing company, not original equipment manufacture, but that is not Amazon's fault. The problem of it being the incorrect part is probably also due to the manufacturing company, not Amazon at all.",0

1443,"Poor sound: This review will strictly address the Blu-Ray version of this movie. This version is produced in 7.1 channel sound. When played through the sound system of my TV (only a 4-year old Toshiba), the sound was full of static at numerous points in the film. Every adjustment I could think of to work around the problem failed. The 5.1 channel extras disc played just fine. The static ruined what could have been an enjoyable movie. So unless your TV and sound system is really current, you could wind up with a bad sound experience too. I have no complaints at all about the video presentation of the film. The visual experience was terrific.",0

I was very perplexed why the authors even decided to write it, why they've decided to live there, why ...... They were very sarcastic about the Tuscan life, its people, its traditions and its values, making fun of everything and everyone in a mean spirited way. They went so far as to make fun of the Italian cuisine and say that nothing is like eating at McDonald's restaurants in the US or eating peanut butter sandwitches for lunch or ...... Why they've decided to live there is a mystery to me and this book was a big disappointment.",0
1449,"A Most Excellent Book: I have lots and lots of woodworking books. This one rates right up there with the best that have ever been published. The thing that delighted me the most was the explanation of how to create the gooseneck molding, the rosettes and the turned (and pierced) flame finials for the top of highboys or grandfather clocks. I have been searching for that information for years.For the novice woodworker, this book is an eye opener. For the folks with more experience, this book is a treasure.",1
1450,"Mounting Difficulties: I was not happy with the challenges to mounting the pads on the bridge. Even after much sanding and filing, the clips that are supposed to hold the pads on the bridge kept popping off as I played. Not only that, but the padding on the clips will not stay glued on. This system is not working for me. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but in its current state the device is not much use to me.",0
1451,"Keep an Open Mind: I think this book does achieve one primary objective. It forces people to get out of their usual comfort zones and begin to explore Christianity a bit deeper than what was learned in Sunday School. Further, this was a highly suspenseful book with great action and Brown is able to put the reader in the midst of some of the more descriptive scenes in France. I thoroughly enjoyed it but I can understand how many out there could give a poor rating. Once individuals are forced out of there comfort zones, a backlash of sorts will result from it.",1
1452,"Marriage God's Way: The author effectively provides couples a succint and biblically sound primer on God's way of handling marriage issues. It could be better organized (spiritual, religious, and social isues) with some chapter combinations and have, as a prerequisite, an altar call for each before engaging in the psychology and social issues.We have used it for over 7 years and 25 couples, reorganized as recommended above, with great success.Thanks for the good work. God bless your efforts of love.",1
1453,"Disappointingly conventional: A long-time fan of Brown, I got this the day it came out. Except for the first couple of songs, the rest of the album is rather conventional and finds him exploring rather mediocre C&W styles & themes. As another reviewer noted, there is an almost total absence of his usual wry wit, and very little of the lyrical and musical complexity at which he excels. Sigh.",0
1454,"Biography: This book is very well written and brings the reader into a closer look of an extraordinary life of an extraordinary person.

1455,"Not worth the money: I am searching for something positive to say about this camera, but I am at a loss for words. Negative things, however, are no problem. In short, the shutter lag is ridiculously long, the picture quality is only fair, the 4mb card only holds 6 pictures at the highest quality, the memory card is almost impossible to remove without strong fingernails or plyers, and the software is inferior to adobe. A friend has a kodak DC215 and it is a much better camera than this one. I returned mine and am going to buy the fuji finepix1400 or the kodak. Consumer reports didn't have much good to say about the poloroid, but liked the fuji and kodak. I must say I totally agree with them.",0
1456,"Cities of Gold: A journey across the American Southwest: I thought this was an outstanding book, so well researched before their trip and so well written describing the areas, the problems encountered and their combined solutions to those situations. I've met Walter Nelson, Mr. Preston's partner on the trip, and that made me understand their friendship and their determination to make it happen even more. It was a great book and I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the Western United States.",1
1457,Kurdish-English/English-Kurdish Dictionary: It is a criminal dishonesty to write a dictionary of a language you don't know it just for financial gain. I am Kurdish and find it disgusting to have a book like this called a Kurdish dictionary. This man should brought to justice.,0
1458,"A doctor that doesn't know biology?: As a biologist and a med. student I am appalled that Crichton made a basic and blatant error that his entire book rests on. If you have a population of organisms, and there is a mutation, THE WHOLE POPULATION DOES NOT MUTATE TOGETHER. The majority of the population stays in the old form. In this book Crichton has a population of organisms that all mutate together into a few scary things and then finally into something harmless and that saves the day. If this were REAL biology we would have a separate population surviving after each mutation. At the end of the book there would still be a population of rubber-eaters as well as a toxic population, etc. Needless to say this ""Deus ad-lib"" was a huge let down. Crichton needs to go back and read some of his biology texts. No wonder he doesn't practice medicine any more.",0

1460,"Hard evidence lacking: Ho-hum, another book purporting to use scientific research to ""prove"" that conservative Christian theology is based on material fact. There are many books like this, where the ""researcher"" gathers only those facts which support his predetermined conclusion, carefully filters the data, and asks leading questions of his hand-picked experts, not like a scientist searching for the truth, but like an attorney trying to win a case. UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy theorists, creationists, and other crackpots try to hijack science to bolster the case for their various obsessions. Isn't religion supposed to concern the realm of the ineffable, the intangible? To dissect it as though it is subject to the material claims of everyday reality reduces the divine to the commonplace.",0
1461,"Slavophobic: I think that the author showed reluctancy to accept the fact that Poles are not the victims of Russians. The clash started long time ago, and it continued into modern times. He writes about the oprression of Ortodox chuch on Uniates but doesent mention the fact that Vatican was and still is much more agressive and much more opressive than the Russian Ortodox church. He also writes about the fact that state should create nation and not the other way around, most of examples are confirming that he is right, but in balkan Peninsula we have situation where nation created the state, and it is the only way for state to fuinction i that part of the world.",0
1462,"Terrible: This book does not cover much of what is covered in actual physics classes. It over explains simple principles and under explains more complex ideas. I used this book as a prep and it was very hard to get through and didn't explain much of what I had to know. Total waste of money. I'm now buying Physics for Dummies, which, now that I have tried and had to drop a college level physics class, is 200% better suited as a companion or prep guide.",0
1463,lame video: This film is kind of embarrassing to watch.There is no Dylan music in the movie so the soundtrack is a never ending vamping rip off of the Desire album. The camera work and lighting is terrible and the interviews are punctuated by weird pop up art and poorly done computer graffics. Watch it if you want to see Rubin Carter sweat under severe lighting in the back room of some photography studio interspersed with cartoon images of boxing gloves and prison bars. Seriously.There are some redeeming moments in the interviews with Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Scarlett Rivera etc. but you really have to fastforward through so much hokum to get to them that it is hardly worth it.,0

1465,Not sensative at all: This trap's trigger mechanism is in no way sensitive enough to kill the mouse. I had 4 traps set in close proximity to where the mouse has been coming to get at our breads. They were all baited with a small amount of peanut butter so it couldn't take the bait and run. Every trap had the bait eaten off the next morning and none of them had been triggered. Do not use this trap if you want to catch your mouse.,0

I am like another reviewer and am worried about what is going to happen to my camera, if i continue to use these discs. I will be contacting the seller for a refund/return.

1467,"This is a good resource for candida sufferers.: I particularly liked the section written by Dr. Rona. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the author had quite as scientific approach as I would prefer. I also found almost all the recipies to have more ingredients and steps than I am willing to use. It was, however, quite comprehensive and easy to follow. I will say that the author does know about foods and had information that was totally new to me. For example, she did not recommended storing onions and garlice in the refridgerator. My total assessment is that this is a good book but I would not use it as my only resource on the subject.",1

1476,"3+ Year Review, Not so good anymore: Bought this over 3, almost 4 years ago, to vacuum my 1,200 sq ft, one-floor house. I've got one wool rug in the living room, and a smaller one in the dining room, maybe 200 sq ft total. The rest of my house is wood floors and ceramic tile. This little Hoover used to work pretty well, I could usually manage to do a quick whole-house vacuum, minus the rugs. Now, I can barely get two bedrooms done without it shutting down due to overheating. Takes at least a half-hour for mine to cool down, sometimes more. I do keep filters clean, it certainly runs nicely when I start, but having to take a couple of long breaks during cleaning is just unacceptable. Maybe they are only meant to last a few years, maybe keep it around for just quick pickups. But will probably just trash it and look for something else. Ultimately, after 3 years, I'm disappointed.",0

The sounds stopped working (the lights would work) and then the problems quickly escalated. I believe that when the on switch is turned to the on position it is not making a complete connection. I called customer service and was disappointed that they couldn't do anything except tell me to replace the batteries (which I had).

Reading the album cover he saw there were horns and decided to give it a go.I suppose this band faded into oblivion because, like Tower of Power, they get no airplay, and unlike TOP, are no longer around to create a new fan base. It's a shame because every person I have ever played ColdBlood and TOP for has become a fan.Lydia Pense is simply an astounding vocalist, and deserves to occupy a place with Janice Joplin and Aretha Franklin.Funny how, with this big revival of the 70's we get to hear disco again, instead of the great horn bands",1

First off the songs sound like they were rushed and that there were not alot of thought put into them.

But obviously the book had to be finished by a certain time so K.A. Applegate had to just end it. That is not how a book should be written.

I have a hard time enjoying a book when I really don't like the main character and I didn't like Jessie. She was the embodiment of today's attitude of it's all about me and no caring of who gets hurt along the way. The story is ridiculous, not even the least bit believable. Monks condoning adultery? Secret poisonous plants? Some of the descriptions of the South Carolina coast were enjoyable but nothing compared to the lyrical quality of Bees. To bad I wasted money on a hardback as it's not a book that will be reread for years to come. Look for it in my next yard sale.",0

The end of the story lends a surprising, profound twist - both unusually humorous and thought provoking.

The heroine was a unappealing teenager who was too naive and too innocent and whose only redeeming quality was that she could shoot well, could tend a garden and could turn heads (male of course). The hero wasn't well developed and came across as bland. There wasn't much chemistry between the two and, aside from their physical passion, they had very few qualities between them to make a solid relationship.I'm not quite sure why I finished the book.

It's supposed to be an ""arcade"" style game which to me implies hopping on your bulldozer or other big tool and playing away.Wrong. This is a game with rules, rules that are not easily apparent. It also has some kind of storyline that is definitely not going to appeal to the short attention span of a very young kid.The graphics are dated and bottom-shelf in any event. No tool tips, so you don't even know what a button is supposed to do without looking at the documentation which, as you might expect, is electronic. How much would it cost to print a quick start sheet or provide a Flash tutorial?My overall impression is that this game is designed to part suckers from their money. It sure feels that way to me. Maybe there is an age group that this would appeal to me, but it's not me (old) and not my grandson (very young).Jerry",0

And Haldeman canreally bang out a good story. On these levels, the book succeedswhere many of its type fail today. It's clearly the last gasp ofa dying breed (and maybe with good reason?). Haldeman's grittinessvirtually ensures that if any of his books ever get made intomovies, the director may have toning down to do rather thantoning up.

1544,"Spies and Murder in the White House: This is another in the series of Elliott Roosevelt's mysteries starring First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. It is June, 1939. World War Two is only weeks away. During the pomp and ceremony of a visit by the King and Queen of England, a young assistant to Eleanor Roosevelt is found murdered. Investigation reveals that she is not the innocent girl that everyone assumed her to be. She was also seen at the German Embassy, and further tracking leads to the realization that murderous German spies have penetrated the White House. For fans of the series, this is a vintage Elliott Roosevelt mystery, with much fascinating insight into the 1939 White House by someone who was there. There is nothing here for the blood and gore violence fan - just a relaxing mystery peopled by Franklin Roosevelt, J. Edgar Hoover, Ernest Hemingway, and other notable figures of the time.",1

These are ""oil-canned"" and not flat. No attempt was made to flatten them out. They are bowl shaped and the edges are square. Not beveled like the picture. I read another complaint before about this and it is true. For the cost I expected some quality. These picks literally cost about a penny a piece to manufacture ""as-sold"". You know how a machine gun sounds on auto-fire? That's how fast a CNC spits out parts like these.",0

1580,"Save your cash: This game was given to me as a gift by a friend. I can honestly say that this game has a long way to go before I would recomend it to anybody. The game came with no instructions and or documentation. There is an online file you can read but I would have to say that it way too vague. Graphics are ok, but not as good as IL-2. The worst problem was with the game play. The servers are horrible including lag and random dropouts and disconnects. There is a help room, but after waiting for half an hour trying to some help I left. I also have to caution parents with young children (as I) about the language used in some of the arenas. Even with system operators monitoring the room, this still continued. Too bad, because it looks like this game could be fun.",0

Have tried all I can think of and my answer is: it must still be registered from the person I purchased it from. In order for me to use QuarkXpress I will have to upgrade to the present day version. Money spent on this version was a waste and I should send it back or just toss in trash!! Sure hope the person I purchased it from is not scamming anyone else!",0

1588,"One of the worst sci-fi books I ever read: This book starts with an intrigue concept but the actual execution is a totally different matter.The author's writing style is sloppy and dry. Characters are at best two dimentional and you don't really care much whether they live or die. The technical aspects of the book is borderline hilarious. So You need some technical minded experts in a particular situation? boom, they poped out from middle of nowhere and get it done.After 100 pages or so, I threw it away.",0
1589,"Awesome: I have had this STEAMER for almost 10 years. Yes, I have replaced the clean water tank twice, but I still consider this an excellent machine. The STEAM comes from the HOT WATER you put in the tank. YEA, I boil the water I put in the tank so it doesn't bother me that I have to replace a $50 part once every 5 years. WHY would you use CARPET SOAP with a steamer? The hot water is what cleans and to really freshen my 6 dog house, I add some non foaming deodorizer to the clean water tank. If used correctly, the carpet is virtually dry by the time you finish. I ALSO use this steamer for non-carpeted areas. The spinning brushes work on any surface. I also use the hand attachment to clean upholstered seats. GREAT MACHINE.",1
1590,"Doesn't even deserve 1 STAR, but I had no choice.: Toy Box's ""Tarzan and Jane"" is probably the worst song that I have ever heard. Basically, it is some new euro dance-pop band trying to cash in on Aqua's one-hit-wonderdom here in the states (even though Aqua should have had many, many hits here). Listen to the song! It sounds exactly like Barbie Girl, though its missing every ounce of ingenuity and style. Toy Box should really be ashamed to do something so low. DO NOT BUY or EVEN LISTEN TO THIS SONG!",0

I thought this book did a very good job of explaining many of the prenatal screenings and tests. I also liked her calming tone. I've decided to write this review because I was taken aback by the negative comments. After I read them all, I realized that those comments were made from the proponents of natural birth. I think giving natural birth is great but some of us don't have that option for medical reasons that require careful monitoring. In that light, I feel that those negative comments should be taken with a grain of salt. Over all, I highly recommend this book to anyone.",1

I've fiddled and screwed with it till I'm ready to scream, and it still doesn't work properly. I get random power disconnection that freezes my computer. It works at a pretty steady 4.4, which is good, but my old Creative Modem Blaster did that, and it still let me restart without having to go to safe mode. Tech support was remarkably unhelpful.

I loved all of it and would suggest it to anyone.I wish they had paid for the rights to her TV specials in the 60's and 70's. She is a true talent and she was at her peak in the 60's-70's. A true entertainer.You will love this film. Don't hesitate in getting it. It's worth every penny!,1

I expected much more from it. The author had only one idea -- ""create a code of honor for your team"" and wrote a book around it. Honestly, I don't think this book has anything to add. I suggest reading The Servant, by James C. Hunter instead. This one is a really awesome book about leadership.",0
1598,"Fun moves in theory, poor execution by Cheryl and Maks: I really wanted to like this DVD for many reasons - learning fun latin dance moves, great cardio, and DWTS favs Cheryl and Maks. The moves/dances they are showing in and of themselves are fine. I did break a sweat and I could see how this would be a good variation to a workout regime.But Cheryl and Maks had NO ENERGY, they were monotone, and that on-camera enthusiasm that makes workout DVDs fun was just not there. and the dancers that were behind them looked like they were bored and wanted to leave. My enthusiasm slowly dwindled as the DVD went on....and on.The silver lining is that there is an option to show the routines with music and no commentary. I think I will learn the routines better and do that instead, just for the added workout boost.",0

It will not work and Amazon will do nothing to replace it. In their promotion on their web page, they demonstrate a 30"" fall and it supposedly still works. Mine fell about the same height and it doesn't.I can have it replaced for an additional $200.00 resulting in an inflated final cost of $559.00. I guess I will just use it for a conversation piece...a very expensive paperweight. Apparently Amazon is not the user friendly organization they would like us to believe.",0
1601,"Bird Bath Heater Performance: This heater does a very good job of keeping the water clear of ice. However the water must be shallow enough (not much deeper that the heater is thick)to work well. When the water is shallow it does work very well. The cord is extremely short for our application and I would think that would be the case for most applications. We had to purchase an additional short, outdoors extension cord. I think the cord on the heater is about 18 inches long. It would be much better if it were at least 36 inches long.",1

1609,"'Please Sir, can I have more?' - Oliver Twist: I heard Hough perform the F minor Sonata at the RFH in London this year and it was broadcast later on radio so I recorded it and compared it with his recording. The recorded version is understandably more conservative than his live perfomance but this takes away some of the exuberance of the youthful Brahms. Roaring octaves in the live performance become clean cut, controlled octaves in the recording. If this were any other pianist's recording I would drool over it, yet this is Stephen Hough and I want more. I expect something extra special when anything comes from Hough's Hyperion recording camp. For those seeking the ultimate Brahms Op.5, have a listen to Clifford Curzon's recording on Decca.The Ballades are excellently performed and recorded, and I particularly enjoyed the floating 4th.",1

Surfers, dopers and new age types might get excited over it but most other viewers will soon lose interest. Looks like it was written and directed by teenagers high on drugs. I'm sure there was a good reason that this series was cancelled at only ten episodes - it truly sucks on so many levels!",0

All it is about is them trying to go back being normal The Thing finally goes back to being human but just changes back and all he was doing was bitch and moan. But when their fighting Dr. Doom that was a pretty good part of the movie but the only good part. This is worser than the Hulk. If they make a sequal find a better director.",0

1625,"These aren't just cock and bull stories: For a logophile such as myself, this book is a treat. Since acquiring it, I've made it a habit (as I've done with some other books in the Facts on File collection) to randomly review at least ten of the entries per day, as ""work,"" and often peruse it just for fun.A good example of an entry is ""all in a dither: In a jittery, agitated state. This expression dates from the early 1800s, when it also was put as *of a dither*. The noun dither comes from the Middle English verb didderen, meaning to 'tremble.' A newer synonym is *in a tizzy,* dating from the first half of the 1900s. Its origin is not known.""Aside from the source of the phrase, this is a useful book to learn *what not to say.* If a word or phrase is clich칠d, it shouldn't be used. In a nutshell, one could consider this book a safe haven from the etymological equivalent of giving up the ghost.",1

The only thing I don't understand is... the lights never go out telling you that the batteries are charged. The paper that came with the chargers said that new batteries should charge 16 hrs. and batteries that have been charged before take about 4 hours.

This hair iron somehow manages to keep it straight all day long, it can be damp and muggy out and my hair still remains straight and no nonsense. The pessimist in me is still waiting for all my hair to fall out one day because the steaming effect on damp-to-wet hair tends to frighten me, but I've been using this for the past 3 months an no harm has come as of yet.Yes, it works on wet-out-of-the-shower hair. No, I wouldn't recommend it (mainly because with all the steam it's hard to avoid burning yourself).

1636,"Weisman's best work to date--the best read of the summer: I've been a John Weisman fan since the early ROGUE WARRIOR books. (Marcinko may have been the featured attraction, but it was Weisman's writing that made the books so enjoyable.) It's great to see him out from under Marcinko's shadow. And with SOAR, Mr. Weisman has finally proven that he doesn't need anyone to tell a superb and exciting story. I read SOAR in one day--and with it, Weisman has joined the ranks of Clancy, Coonts, Dale Brown, and the best of the techno-thriller writers. All the Weisman trademarks, the ones we loved in the Rogue Warrior novels are here--the author's skill with action scenes, descriptions of the latest cutting edge technology, and the edge-of-the-seat suspense we expect from the genre. Highly recommended, and the best read of the summer.",1

The game does have a wonderful tutorial for learning the controls that from start to finish is only about an hour long. EIDOS should have packaged this game with a 300 page quick referance guide just for the controls. This is probably the worst game I have ever purchased. Granted it is very complicated to learn; however you would think it would be fun to play once you get the controls down. Even though it's supposed to be an action game I did not find much action in it at all,0

I can't believe people would take the time to review this and then send other fans after this film with ratings that are above 2 stars. If you are a huge Miyazaki fan like me, you most definitely will be disappointed by how lacking this one is compared to his other films. You will get no action, and then very little, for over 70 minutes. If you have to have it for collection purposes, then make room on your shelf, cause it ain't moving but once. If you are about to spring for what you hope to be another Ponyo, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, etc., then you need to either borrow it first or rent it.

This is a good collection of some of the classics that Country Joe and the Fish made in the 1960s, and the title song is as relevant in this wartime period as it was during Vietnam. These songs span a wide range from the sharp satire in the title song to surprisingly tender songs. Although the sound quality could be somewhat better, the quality of the singing and instrumentals is quite good. These are songs that people should be listening to--and singing--now.",1

In this sprightly Australian romantic comedy, the heroine (Griffiths, in a subtle yet appealing performance) gets a chance to find out what would have become of her if, at that big fork in the road, she had headed in the other direction.Like Sliding Doors (1998), director-writer Pip Karmel's Me Myself I allows its protagonist a do-over. Griffiths is a single, successful magazine writer in her 30s who wonders what would have happened if she had accepted a marriage proposal 13 years earlier from her then-beau, an architect.After being hit by a car, she gets to find out -- waking up to find herself wed to said overbearing man and serving as stay-at-home mom to three needy children. The point Me Myself I makes, amusingly but at some length, is that while the grass may always seem greener on the other side, once you get there, all you'll want to do is mow it.",1
1649,"It would be difficult to make a tarp with thinner material: I doubt this tarp will last more than a month or two for my application of this tarp being the top of a composting box 62"" x 72"" . Each grommet is used with a bungi ( tight, but not excessive). After first day, signs of corners already breaking through due to friction from 20 mph winds causing tarp to move a bit and rub on corners of wood pallets. 2 grommets have been somewhat dislodged from original pressed placement. This tarp would be good for a windless area, such as under a tent or to cover some boxes in the garage, or maybe a small woodpile in a windless area. This is one of those products where you get what you pay for.",0
1650,"Only 1080i NOT 1080P and Dolby Digital MONO: Blu-Ray should ALWAYS BE 1080P It is very disappointing when it is not. This is reflected in the image quality as well. Audio is not even remastered for surround and is in 1 Channel MONO. I can't believe they would even release this on Blu-ray this way as it is seemingly no better than standard DVD or even VHS! I am very disappointed in the product. The movie is a great 80's Flick but I just wish that they had taken a little more care and time to release it the right way.... Do not buy if only upgrading from a previous medium. If you have not previously owned this title then it is, unfortunately, still the best way to go.Girls Just Want to Have Fun [Blu-ray]",0

1654,"very disappointing: I am very disappointed by this book, especially since it was supposedly so good as to be made into a movie. The character is extremely unlikeable, not only do her actions ruin her own life but they hurt other people's too. Like the issue with her parents neighbors, which I find irresponsible and disrespectful. It reminds me of those movies where you cringe watching the main character make a complete fool of themself because you can see it coming a mile away. She's one major disaster after another. I'm about 3/4ths of the way done and just put it down because it was so depressing, but since I have it I'm finishing with the hopes this girl gets a clue and the book gets much better!!",0

1659,A song for shadows: This week I had the pleasure of seeing The Echoing Green perform live in Minneapolis with Freezepop and some local bands. While at the show I picked up a copy of The Winter of Our Discontent by The Echoing Green and Pristina's Stars and Sirens. Pristina is Joey Belville's side project featuring an array of female vocalists whose vocals are set to laid back downtempo electronic beats. I have really been enjoying Stars and Sirens a lot. The music is very relaxing and soothing to chill out to. I enjoyed all the singers featured on the album. There is not a single track on the album that I did not enjoy.,1

1661,"Bette Midler singing songs from the 1940s and 1950s: Given her affinity for 1940's boogie woogie in the style of the Andrews Sisters, the idea of putting Bette Midler in a film that at least starts off during World War II seems like a natural. Indeed, you will find some nice period pieces by Midler, usually with Johnny Mercer's name on the composition, such as ""Come Rain or Come Shine."" But I have to admit to a slight sense of disappointment that the producers of this film seemed to go out of their way not to do anything too close to the songs that made the Divine Miss M famous in the first place. Ironically, the best track on the album is her wonderful cover of the Beatle's ""In My Life,"" which deservedly made its way onto Midler's greatest hits collection. This is a solid Midler album, the sort that comes in at 4.5 and then you round up or down according to your tastes.",1
1662,"Good value and enjoyable: I got this as a present for my 4 year-old who is in ballet lessons. She loves ballet and really wanted this. It's very much geared to a younger child, with the music and dance. It progresses from a dance studio to the ""finale"" on a real stage. This provides a nice change of pace. The production is high quality and very professional.I liked the lead dancer, she's very appealing for a young child to watch. The barre is nice for support, it's not intended to be anything more than that. The point is for the children to learn how to dance without the barre. It leads them through a variety of steps and sequences and then at the end it's all put together into a scene from Swan Lake. I think the pace is just right. It's assumed that this will be watched several times. The teaching is done through demonstration, not through detailed explanation.Our set contained two dvds and mats, one for Swan Lake and one for the Lets Go Dance introductory dvd.",1

Personally i liked the new versions of some of the songs (canzione d치more, india) but on the others i prefer the original versions (collage, gioco de bimba, sguardo verso il celo, la porta chiusa). It is a good album but if you can, get the original albums ""collage"", ""uomo di pezza"", ""contrapunti"" and ""verita nascoste"" all of them are masterpieces.",1

1672,"More than just silly fun: Yeah I admit, I was a little embarressed to be buying this anime. But it also looked so cute I just couldn't help myself. After watching the first DVD I was impressed. Not only is the Super Gals alot of fun but you also see a different side of the ""Kogal"" lifestyle. In reading the manga ""Peach Girl"" I was given a brief understanding of Kogals; they were stupid tanned bimbos who were easy and might sell themselves to you. In Super Gals I saw in Ran that not all Kogals are like that. She shows it's possible to have fun being a Kogal while also keeping her dignity. I also really enjoyed the fact that there are cultural notes on the backside of the poster. Something I have not seen many anime distributors do except for fansubbers and I always thought there should be more of instead of just trying to ""Americanize"" it for us. So yeah, all and all I really enjoyed Super Gals because not only is it fun but it actually provides some pop culture education about one side of Japan.",1

It is full of rambling prose, and uninteresting characters, in a very boring, uneventful plot. Why would anyone want to write such a book? What is the point? Matteo and Sophie aren't very deep people, and the bit about the Mother was so uninteresting. It wasn't even worthy of one star and is in such contrast to books by the same author, that have a soul. Why would anyone want to write about this kind of indulgent, boring uninteresting people, even though I know their type exists. They aren't worthy to be characters in any literature.",0

The heating element in the iron has also burned out, so it's no longer usable (the iron doesn't get hot, so the steam condenses and water splatters all over the clothes).

The whalestoe letters were great, and the 50 year sword, amazing.This is not to be classed with those books.This book is more of a freeform poetry style of writing, and is notoriously difficult to read. You read 8 pages of Sam, and then flip and read 8 pages of Hailey. You'll understand that when you get it. The book chronicles the road trip of a young couple, and is very well stylized in doing so.I wouldn't dare say this book is bad, and overall I'd recommend this book. I was just hoping for something as engrossing as House of Leaves. It let me down in that aspect, but it also surprised me in many ways.",1

There are some things that you must read in the game manual (the biggest one is to use the ""grip"" button (E on the PC version) when Lara does not have a strong grip on a ledge...if you do not you fall...always). The book shows the moves in the PS2/Xbox controls and not the PC (generally speaking). No question about it though I had used the guide in a few spots to continue the game.",1

I absolutley love each song to pieces.The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finishMy favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!",1

1694,"Wonderful Format: Beautiful illustrations, but the morals at the end don't always seem to fit the usually very brief story. So many of them are about pride and vanity. And where's the famous story of Androcles and the Lion? I give it four stars mostly because of the large size and large print and the illustrations, all of which should be pleasing to children. Those illustrations are wonderful. And I liked the font, which is very old-fashioned. This is a reprint of a book originally printed in 1914, and the publishers have kept that look. A good buy for your children, I should think. Children always love stories wherein animals talk, and are like people. This is the original. A good moral thrown in never hurts, either. E.g., ""A kindness is never wasted.""",1

1697,power ranger horror: If you are looking for an absolutely horrendous sequel to the Wishmaster this is it. I haven't seen the third installment of wishmaster but thought the first two with the original actor who played Wishmaster were great. I picked this sequel up figuring it was wishmaster and wouldn't be that bad...boy was I wrong. It was like a mix between Power Rangers and Japanese Anime/old-school Godzilla. Not only is the acting horrible but the story is too. What happened to the good quality old school horror that was good even if the story was horrible it was a decent movie worth seeing...the Prophecy Fullfilled is not and I will say DO NOT waste your mney...it is disappointing.,0
1698,Dymo hand held label tape makers: Spend a few dollars extra and get the pink one (the one with two extra print wheels). It's a different product and is vastly superior to the Dymo Organizer Xpress Pro. I found the Xpress Pro to be an unsatisfactory piece of junk; several complaints but the most serious one is that the letters are spaced too far apart on the tape. The pink one works like the Dymo machines of old.,0

The point I am making is that his books are far superior to this version of Fear and Trembling. The entire book looks as if it was made on a printer at home and there are no copyrights or publisher info. Someone copy and pasted (I hope because now I am afraid to read what might be garbage) from the internet and slapped it in a book and printed it off. This is not what I paid for. If you are thinking about buying Fear and Trembling make sure that there is a publisher attached to it. This is the lesson I have learned from my mistake.",0

It seems to be written for a much younger audience, despite its length. While Levine has some cute ideas about how Never Land functions, I found the fairies' personalities to be so one-dimensional as to be almost non-existent and the art to be a hideous pastiche of icky-poo sweet ersatz Disney. The book might work well as a read-aloud for three or four year-olds with a good attention span; I would hesitate to give it to anyone older. Please, Ms. Levine, go back to letting your wit and intelligence and humor show!",0

You couldn't help but feel Snow's pain at her mother's deathbed confession, leaving Snow feeling that she has no identity at all. As Snow's search for her biological mother comes to a close, the mystery of the woman who raised her for the past 30 years is just starting to take hold. The author had a wonderful story going here until the end, when you are left hanging. I have never liked books that leave open storylines. Even if it is part of a series, or if there is going to be a sequel, each book should be self-contained and with completed storylines. I feel like I was left reading half a book. I do hope the author has plans to do a sequel and put closure to this.",1

Definitely an awesome album worth buying!! My favorite track would be Emotionless. In this song, Benji and Joel spill their hearts out to their dad. Although it's kind of depressing to listen to compared to their other upbeat songs, it's a very very well-written, well-composed track. :-) Overall, if I could, I'd rate the album 20 out of 5!!! haha :-) Check it out, definitely!",1

Opera shows off Destiny's Child's amazing vocal skills and harmony. The other songs do too, but their just not very good. The other songs I feel as if they're trying too hard to sound good. They should just sing naturally and it would be awesome. Don't buy this, it's only worth the two tracks.",0

In all, this is exactly what we wanted and it stands nicely and has been quite sturdy to date. The high is low enough for the adults to crossover without moving, which is a plus since once locked into the width of the location it is not easily retracted. Perfect for our use but keep in mind that it is short in height.",1
1725,"Probably useful, but...: Given the price I paid for the book, I expected something better than a Docutech print-out of hard copy. The least they could have done was run the electronic files through the Docutech (a high-end copier) so that the screen captures showed up a little better than fuzzy.The other problem I had was the lack of anything approaching a professional touch in the layout and design of the book. The person or persons who laid out the book did a poor to mediocre job of it at best. Given the subject matter -- writing software documentation -- I would have expected the author and publisher to put even *some* effort into creating a useful visual language. As it is, there may well be useful, important information in the text, but the design of the book is so poor, I'll be damned if I can track it down.",0

With this cd, it's obvious that they've become a pop band with (presumably) punk hair cuts. If you liked Let it Burn or Bad Story Happy Ending, do not buy this cd.",0
1729,"But Out of this World: Overlooked classic effort from Nektar. I'm not as ""distracted"" by the Ringmaster voiceovers as the other reviewers. In the case of 'Nellie the Elephant', it's an essential part of the song. Superb and seamless production, great ensemble ideas that aren't beat to death. Forget the labels!

1734,"Pitiful,just pitiful!: I understand how publishing companies need to make money,but, you would think they would use a ghost writer that had read the previous books. I started noticing bad proofreading and editing, then characters were not as intelligent, as they were in earlier books. I don't know,, I have loved every book,though some were very redundant. You could always find some kind of redemption in each.. It is with a sad heart I say goodbye to some very old friends.. I wish I knew where they ended up!",0

1738,"Waste of Time and Money: This book was written by someone who has spent a short amount of time in the business and probably did a fair but not large amount of sales. I am surprised she says she is a sales manager. In her mathematical example (20% of purchase price), she couldn't even get the answer correct. Having been in the business for 20 years, I found it very weak with substance and it appears to have been written by someone who thinks she is a trainer but isn't. Sorry. It was a waste of my money.",0

It does everything I was hoping for.BTW the battery issue is fixed that everyone was talking about in earlier reviews.Two small complaints, One, the bottom edges of the remote are very rounded so it is very hard to hold onto to hit the buttons. Two,the organization of the GUIDE,EXIT,MENU,INFO buttons could be logically organized so I don't have to put my glasses on to read them.",1

Half(or ONE WHOLE SET!) of these dinner plates have broken since we recieved them. Two of these we found broken in the dishwasher, despite them supposedly being ""Dishwasher Safe"". The other two were broken after placing them under a hot faucet. This is just unacceptable.DO NOT BUY THESE PLATES! We have cheap plates from Wal Mart that have lasted 5+ years with no breaks like these. Will never buy this brand again.",0
1742,"Very good: Connelly keeps getting better and better as the series progresses. Bosch is investigating an unsolved cold case when he gets a call that promises to lead him to the killer. The obvious becomes confused as intrigue and lies are embedded in the case and the case is nowhere near as simple as it seemed. A fine, fine thriller. Recommended.",1

1745,"horrible design: first of all, the nite light didn't work.I am an engineer so things I buy get heavily scrutinized. The unit comes with three DC adapters, but only one fits the baby monitor. The other two are for the parental units, but will not charge a rechargable AAA battery. The battery doors are not designed to be removed easily (feels like I'm about to break the latch when it finally releases) and since the unit does not charge rechargable batteries. The baby monitor does not accept batteries, so if you want to move it you need to bring the DC adapter along with.It's going back.If these things are not important to you then fine, I have not tested the range further than upstairs/downstairs and then only for a very short time so I will not comment on this.Best,Dan",0
1746,"So Much More is Possible When We Think Together: This is a tested methodology for 'linking minds' -- and consequently realizing answers and producing insights that are not possible approaching a question or problem on your own. Provided that the group is aligned around a common purpose and no individual seeks recognition at the expense of others, the Thoughtstorm process described in this book will produce a lot of ""Aha!!"" moments. The suggested questions, always preceded by a situation, are valuable to consider. The book is logically organized, concise, and leads to an expanded view of the world.",1

I feel that Dodge should do a recall and start refunding money.Have a nice day.",0
1748,"Piece of Junk: I purchased this item and it stopped working in less than a week. What a complete piece of garbage. My guess is that water gets into it and causes it to stop working. If you take it out and let it dry for a few days, it'll work for a few minutes before taking another dump.",0
1749,"A more excellant way: This book should be a best seller.. After reading it my husband and I went to Georgia to Pleasant Valley Church, Henry Wright Pastors and recieved what the Father had for us.. It is a must read for anyone that wants their life to be changed..",1
1750,"So you're telling me you aren't busy enough? =0): I purchased this book awhile back - before I was in the salon business... now that I'm 'in it' and building my clientele - I am finding this a really nice marketing & promotions reference.It's important to keep your mind fresh with ideas!This book is so chock-full of them that some may work for you now - while others may work more for you later down the road.I, personally, have found the ""Using Publicity Power to Spread News about your Salon"" and the ""Use a Publicity Kit to Multiply your Publicity Power"" as the most useful to me so far... Giving me information that I hadn't thought about! ( I love that!)I think it is time for a new edition of this 1998 book since email, websites or online purchasing is not included.BUT, even without those aspects included - this is a wonderful reference that every salon owner or professional should have in their library!",1
1751,"Spiritual without the Baggage: What I like about this album is that it is spiritually minded, even Christian, without being heavy handed or preachy. Most of the songs are honest cries from a seeking heart. The songs aren't sappy or melodramatic. I related to them immediately. Beware, though- if you're a normal Christian music fan, this music may not appeal to you. It seems to slip out of the confines of the genre and speak to all of us. At least, it did to me.",1
1752,"Take me back!: A very dear friend of mine played these songs for me eons ago, before I moved north. He even gave me a recording which I proceeded to wear out until it was pilfered by a college acquaintance. This music has haunted me ever since. How happy I was to see it had been re-released on CD! I love the music of Tim and Mollie O'Brien because of it's nostalgic effect. My favorite song is Take Me Back because, in truth, you can't go home again -- except in memories.",1
1753,"Not funny, full of negativity, and badly written: Hmmm... I picked this book up from the clearance table at the bookstore and sat down and read it while drinking some coffee. About the time I finished my coffee, I finished the book. It's very short and just not very well written, and I agree with other reviewers that the editing is severely lacking. I'm not a big Jenny fan, but I really thought I might laugh once while reading this book, but I didn't. My main reaction to it was pity. When I read the part about ""psycho chick"", I felt really bad for her that she had such an insensitive husband. And her reactions to her pregnancy problems made it seem like she just wasn't prepared for pregnancy. But the main problem I had with the book was the negativity, I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book, but I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is pregnant for the first time or hasn't been pregnant. She makes pregnancy sound like a horror show.",0
1754,So so: It is very thick and like jello coming out of the bottle. I have not noticed any difference in my hair except that it is more difficult to comb after washing.,0
1755,"worked mostly well: I gave the set 4 stars because, for the most part, it worked as described. However, I didn't expect the batter to stick to the sides I had lightly greased with Crisco that way it did. I would up holding a side with needle-nosed pliers while pressing down on the center with the bottom end of a wide laddle. I did this rather than using a thin knife around the edges as I didn't want to risk nicking the griddles no-stick finish. But the end product was a very good English muffin. Well worth the extra effort.",1
1756,"Great primer but there are alternatives: The book is informative and will shed light on topics that are usually glossed over in classical programming texts. If you're a high-level language programmer , hidden behind impressive abstraction layers ( .Net, JavaScript, etc ), the information contained will probably not be of much practical use.On the other hand if you would like to ( partially ) know what the hardware/software you use everyday is doing behind your back then this is a good read.I bought the text some time ago and recently decided to read it immediately after having read Tanenbaum's Structured Computer Organization.While Hyde's book is good and has some specific details regarding programming optimization, the depth and clarity of Tanembaum text is definitely superior.",1
1757,Great Travel Mug: I use this thing on my drive to work at least 3 days a week for about a year. I've never once had a leak or a spill (knock on wood). It's a little big for the cup holder but it fits and that's what matters. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a save way to transport your morning beverage.,1
1758,Worst BT headset on the market: I got this along with my LG PM-325 Sprint phone. It never syncs correctly and shuts off all the time in between calls. Do not buy this item unless you want a perpetual headache. It is more dangerous to drive using it than just talking into the handset. I am always trying to get it to turn back on even if it has only been seconds between calls.,0
1759,"Ten New Songs: Boogie Street and Alexandra Leaving are especially haunting, but I love the whole album. You might think to skip it because it is not a solo album, it's a collaboration with Sharon Robinson. Don't skip it. It's great.",1
1760,"This is an unbelievably bad book: Let's face it, this series is dead, let's put a bullet in it. I have been a loyal Wheel of Time reader for close to 7 years now and all I can say is that it really does seem as if this author is writing just to make money now. There is no doubt in my mind that the last 2 books could have been combined as so little happens in each book. That would be bad enough but it also seems as if the characters are becoming very two dimensional. Try to figure out who I am describing, she is petty, vain and in competition with every woman in the book. That's right, you guessed it, I have described every female character in the last book. It makes me so angry that I can't write because I'm too busy putting my fists on my hips! This book is a sad testimony to money driven publishing, I feel like I wasted part of my life by reading it.",0
1761,Two Words: REALLY BAD: compaired to their other 3 albums this album is their worst. i liked the others because when i heard them i felt that i relaited. they came out with this album in one year and it shows the reason that i like no doubt was because they had good lyrics and the albums showed care and this one had like a course and that was it. i hate pop and hip hop. because its not even music. if anyone is a tragic kingdom or return of saturn fan i advise you not to buy this album,0
1762,Tales From the Brothers Grimm and the Sisters Weird: This book is full of variations of many famous fairy tales. I was particually interested in the varition of Rumpelstiltskin. Velde also wrote a book called the Rumpelstiltskin problem which includes one of these stories which creativly shows the different twists of the story! Very interesting.,1
1763,Isuzu grille clip: These clips are not quite as large as the original clips. Although the difference in size is just a couple millimeters it required that I had to trim every clip a little deeper in order for it to clip in and lock in place. Using these clips made a 10 minute job an hour long.,0
1764,"too skinny: this is THE book to get if you are still choosing a PC to run Logic on. Half the book is taken up with detail on SCSI/UDMA/Memory/Motherboard configurations better for audio use.if you already have this bit sorted, the remainder of the book is no more than a flashy introduction to the audio capabilities of logic. info of this small depth should be free.definitely not a manual, or lasting companion to recording audio on a PC. still waiting for Fast Guide to Logic Audio!",0
1765,excellent product easy to use: Does what it says... Easy one step installation... Definately worth the very low price compared to similar products,1
1766,"love this book: I bought this for research on a paper I was writing and ended up using this as the main point of reference. I focused on the Xena piece and loved it, but the others are good, too.",1
1767,"HIgh Expectations Disappointed: The premise of this book is excellent; unfortunately, the novel needed better editing, both in content and in style: at one crucial point, a villain-type is described as being down on ""all fours,"" with his hands behind his back -- that impossible position makes the rest of this very important scene unbelievable. Also, better editing would have corrected such obvious and disappointing errors as the constant misspelling of ""all right"" and the erroneous use of the past tense form of the verb ""lie."" I was so looking forward to this book, but I couldn't finish it.",0
1768,"Don't waste your Money: The Author Mark E. Ripple clearly does NOT know what he's talking about. ""Handicapping the Wall Street Way"" is a great example of an author clearly way out of his league. He boasts and rationalizes why he is winning certain races, and quite frankly has no idea what he's talking about. If your in finance and wondering..... is it worth reading....don't even bother reading this awful excuse for a book on handicapping.... It can only hurt your money management at the track. One would think that a savvy wall street guru would be able to use variance and standard deviation as a measure of risk in a horse race?",0

1770,"OK for new construction: If you are building your own home this book MIGHT be worthwhile. The mantel designs are mediocre at best.If you are doing a remodel and looking for design ideas, don't waste your money or time looking at this book. I have found the same photos browsing through the internet or picking up brochures at a home center. There is absolutely NO effort on the part of the author to find interesting or unique fireplace designs. I was really hoping to find more ideas and was seriously disapointed within the first five pages.",0
1771,"Disc 2: The movie Wizard of Oz was wonderfuls. I've always wanted it in my collection. This disappointment came when I played Disc 2 ""The Life and Times of Author Frank Baum."" It Was Out Of Focus and therefore I could not watch it. This is the first time I have gotten a dud from Amazon.",0
1772,"The best thing in this book is the mention of Constantine Maroulis in the dedication: Yes, I confess that the only reason I purchased this book was because Constantine Maroulis was mentioned in the dedication. I'm about half way through the book now, but I don't really want to finish it. The grammatical errors are plentiful! I can not believe that a book with this many mistakes could be published. I think that the premise of the story is cute; Johnie being in love with two men who are in fact, both the same man. I get the point of the story, however, it is just going on and on and becoming monotonous. El/Spike is NOT Constantine Maroulis or anything like him for that matter... except, oh yeah... he has long hair and sings. I truly do not recommend that anybody waste their valuable time reading this comedy of errors. By the way... Constantine Maroulis Rocks!** I am editing to add... thank goodness I am done reading this book. I couldn't wait for it to be over. This woman seriously needs an editor.",0
1773,"See ya!: Since it's inception, X-Treme X-Men has had it's share of up's and down's. Even though it's been scripted by legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont, this title really showed his flaws as a writer, and the flaws within the X-Men mythos that Claremont himself is and was responsible for to begin with. Prisoner of Fire, the final collected arc of the series, finds Storm, Shadowcat, Gambit, Rogue, Bishop, Sage, and the rest of the crew on the trail of a genericly written villain that naturally leaves the door open for another encounter. Igor Kordey's art looks more improved than what we have seen on his various stints on New X-Men, but it doesn't have long to impress since this TPB comes to an end rather quickly. Since X-Treme X-Men has come to an end, Claremont has returned to writing Uncanny X-Men and is also the scribe of the newly launched Excalibur book, both of which are currently faring better than almost anything to be found in the entire X-Treme X-Men series.",0

1775,"Nice songs, horrible mix: I really enjoy the modern approach to antique sounding British folk music represented by this album. The musicianship seems high but for one problem. The vocals are distant, often muddled and indistinct, and the vocalist is fairly lackluster. He is no Richard Thompson, (band member from a long time ago) that's for sure. If it's true that this is an artifically ""lived"" version of studio recordings, as is rumored in another review - well you think they could have gotten the mix right. I can't imagine a band allowing this to happen, what a bizarre idea. Good band, lousy album. However the songs Hiring Fair and Close to the Wind are worth having - maybe they exist elsewhere in better recorded sound.",0
1776,"Not a good dictionary and even worse tapes: I bought the books and the tapes. In the book there is no index, there is no word for word translation so one knows what words mean. Just a bunch of phrases with a hopefully accurate translation - though from what I've read here that may be suspect. Meanwhile the tapes are spoken in rapid fire Thai and there is no chance to learn the pronunciation. Overall this is a poor effort.",0

1778,"Didn't work at all.: I got this to use with my iPod nano (4th Gen)--not sure if it was a compatibility issue, but for whatever reason, this never worked. Great price, but as it turns out, not worth it!",0
1779,"worst purchase: You can fit a couple lenses and a camera body and a few accessories in it. That is fine. But the material is stiff and unyielding. Putting things in and taking things out of this bag is a nightmare. The pockets are small, as they should be for a bag that is low profile and compact. But when I reach my fingers in the pockets to retrieve items the zippers scratch up my hands. I have small hands and simply taking out something as small as a rear lens cap is a big headache. I cannot stress how much I hate this bag. I never use it. It is good for transporting your stuff if you don't want a bulky bag to carry around. But I don't recommend it for using on a shoot because you will be fighting with it for your stuff the whole time.",0
1780,"detectives were vain not thorough: The book lacked authenticity from start to finish. Important facts that contradicted the story were simply ignored and left out. The detectives involved come off as totally vain and angry, envious people, looking to find a high profile case like the Billionaire Boys Club or Menendez brothers murder cases. What these detectives were looking for was their own personal glory. How sick is that.",0
1781,"A Good Story: Alan Williams provides a good story of determination and perseverance in his quest to be a member of the Wake Forest University basketball team for four years. His is a story of being the guy at ""the end of the bench,"" never getting much playing time. But, he is a member of the team, and ultimately he wins the admiration of his coaches and fellow teamates. This is a good book for anyone who enjoys big time college basketball and who wonders about the role of less talented players.",1

At first I thought the book was pretty cute, but as we got more and more into the book I noticed the HORRIBLE grammar being used in the book. Its not just this book either, the whole series has horrible grammar!!!!! I don't think its appropriate AT ALL for children who are beginning to read and spell to see that kind of grammar. I mean if it was once or twice throughout the book, okay fine that is kind of cute. But the whole book and SERIES is the same. Horrible grammar on every page (i.e. runned around my room, I helded my head up...ect.)Not only the grammar but Junie B. is a total brat!!! She whines and cries until she gets what she wants. What a handful!All the children in my Son's first grade class love these books! Its awesome they love books and reading but Its a shame they love such horrible books!",0
1790,Exciting mystery !!: A teenage girl is accused of murdering her father after a strange call from her dad and then a man entering her father's apartment. Join this teenage girl as she hides from the police while trying to find her father's real murderer. There are lots of detail and intriging mystery. If you liked Caroline B.

1792,"i love this.: Was fortunate to see them live like... 3 years ago. The Troubador in Santa Monica,CA. I didn't know what to expect but they rocked. This record is better than the last Deftones record. Its dark, moody and slow. Live, they have a bit more of a rock band feel. Everything is more dynamic live. Which is hard to pull off. Anyhow, fans of Deftones probably won't have a hard time digesting this. Those who aren't fans of the Deftones still might like it too if you like spacey rock ala the Mars Volta with maybe a little more mellow feel. Great record. A sidenote: Chino isn't the only vocalist on this record. Another member, Rob Crow sings and does it well. The only vocal i don't care for is the girl, Mary. Her vocals are neither very moving or very unique. Sounds like some chic doing a demo at home. Which turns out, thats exactly what she did. Maybe if she had a producer to push her, she wouldn't sound half asleep. Oh well... it still rocks.",1

My daughter was unable to use these new, expensive bearings in her latest competition. I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase.",0
1797,"Do not miss this amazing album!: This was the first Fela Kuti album I listened to, and I still feel like it's the best.

Fela Kuti takes things always a step further, adding a serious political message to all of his seemingly upbeat happy songs, so there truly is something for everyone in his songs. Anyway, if you've never heard Fela or Afrobeat, try this album...it will blow your mind.",1
1798,"Super Sound: Ashamed to say I had never heard of James Last, his orchestra and chorus, until I saw a squib on German TV and learned that he is among the top-selling recording artists in the world today. Apparently his ""danceable"" versions of familiar melodies is all the rage in Europe and beyond with 170+ albums to his credit. Amazon offers several and I just picked one at random since I liked some of the selections. Well, folks, this is stellar stuff. Easy listening at its finest. My guess is: pick any one and you will be pleased. The price is pleasing too.",1
1799,"Has mistakes that no beginer could correct: While the patterns are all cool looking and generally very simple to make, there are some mistakes that a beginner could not fix on her/his own. To make matters worse, I've searched the net for errata which does not seem to exist.",0
1800,"Watch Out: This could have been an outstanding product if it wasn't for the decision to take footage from multiple concerts and put them along one audio track. If you didn't understand that (which is very possible) while watching, say, 'Around the world' you HEAR one show throughout, but the footage was edited so that you could see up to 3 different performances along that audio. Because of this you'll have syncing issues. If you are a musician you will notice it looks awkward then figure out ""Hey what i SEE them playing, isn't what I'm HEARING"". This in my opinion, spoils the continuity of the DVD. I recommend buying slane castle, even though they touched up anthony's voice on it.",0

1802,"This book is boring.: Where is this book going? Somehow Picard and others get on a planet, that is in a midst of a war. Then some of them are taken prisoner. Dr. Pulaski does make an appearence in this book, but she is only medicore, not the quick witted doctor that we met in the series. This book is boring and confusing, I do not recommend it. Anyways, what does Gulliver's Fugitives mean, I never understood that.",0
1803,"One of my family's all-time favorite snacks!: Fruity Booty is a favorite in our house. The kids love to eat it while saying its name and giggling, and I love it because it's such a great alternative to the ubiquitous Goldfish (another favorite of ours). This almost (almost!) tastes like Froot Loops, but without the nasty preservatives, sugar and food dyes and additives. My 3 children can pretty easily go through a bag of Fruity Booty in one sitting, making it an expensive snack if purchased a bag at a time in the health foods store. This price for a case is a much better deal, especially with the $10 off special Amazon is offering now.",1
1804,"What happened?: This series was great, good, great, great, and then WHAT HAPPENED! This movie was pointless. Someone must have run out of ideas. This movie had nothing to do with anything. It had a language spot too. Sad ending to a line of good clean movies.",0
1805,"Misleading product description: It is described by the seller as a ""Flat clinch standard stapler"". No mention is made that it is only a ""half strip"" stapler as is clearly marked on the box when you receive it. Leaving ""half strip"" out of the description leads the buyer, like me, to believe you are getting a stardard full length stapler. This is only a half stip, so do not make the mistake of comparing it to other full strip staplers. If you compare to other short half strip staplers, you will find that other sellers offer a better deal.",0

It was really my mistake that I still spent $65 for this worthless piece of garbage.Well, I still have to fly out tomorrow and won't be able to keep in touch with family. That is disappointing.",0

It makes your skin looks absolutely flawless and smooth without making it seem like you are wearing any makeup at all!

1814,Does not rake our leaves well: I see larger machines of this nature in the hay fields so thought it would work well on my leaves. It did not. We have a number of Southern oaks in our yard and many leaves in the spring. This rake did a poor job of raking them into windrows. It takes many passes with the rake and even then doesn't get them all. It might work well on a different type of leaf but for the live oaks and similar varieties it just down't work.,0

The rack is perfect size in that it doesn't take a lot of space on my counter - and also --- very easy to clean.,1
1817,"Chemical Thermodynamics: In the McGraw-Hill Series in Advanced Chemistry, an introduction to the basic principles are presented. The presentation is organized in a systematic order which allows each principle to be built upon. The problems at the end of each chapter are pleasantly challenging and require critical thinking of the principles investigated. However, the text is overwhelmed with errors in its equations and logic. This becomes an annoyance as one tries to learn the material presented. Due to this fact, the book is hardly worth the price. Many other books can clearly present the same material.",0

1820,"How stupid...: This F13 has to be the worst, and that's coming from a die hard F13 fan. First of all, it's not even really Jason in this film. It's some posing psycho that puts on the mask and slaughters a few kids. What really made this film stupid, is how the murder scenes were directed. Most of the teenagers died at the same time!The only part that was really cool was when an unexpected, beat up hill billy was decapitated while in motion. I guess that scene was to make the audience gasp. Obviously they needed something to attract the audience from death of boredom.I hate to critize an F13 film, but this one was just terrible. Save your money, and don't buy this one. Two stars at the most.",0
1821,Wonderful.: This was an excellent movie. I am very pleased with the way the series ended and I encourage all fans to purchase this item and enjoy it as much as I did.,1

1824,"God awful blood vehicle: Zombie attempts to glamorize his gore-fest by saying it's a tribute to '70's horror flicks, but the movie is the trashiest, most god awful waste of film I've ever seen. I regret even thinking Zombie had made a decent film.",0
1825,"My all-time favorite Hitchcock film!: I first saw this movie when I was about 12-years old, and I thought it was incredible! Thirty years later my opinion hasn't changed in the least! The suspense in this one is illustrative as to why Hitchcock is considered a genius! And the casting is brilliant! Not only is this one of Hitchcock's best, it's one of American cinema's all-around greatest films! Why they felt they had to re-make this one using Christopher Reeve is beyond me! I mean, why tamper with perfection?",1

The samples should be enough to motivate you, but I really consider this one of the best....Ever...",1
1828,"Another fine mess by Madacy: Typical Madacy mish-mash, made up of old documentaries thrown together to make a multi-DVD set, complete with a colorful, attrative box to appeal to the average consumer who wouldn't know otherwise. If you occassionally like watching old documentaries/propaganda films, fine....but the outside of the contents (the box) need to state honestly what's inside, and not hype it up to appear like it's a big-budget production (like a History Channel or National Geographic product - now THOSE are worth buying). Madacy has a problem with that, because they know most people won't buy it....or at least pay the asking price. This stuff needs to be on the bargain rack ($10 max).",0

When i opened this cream, it smelled and looked different from the real one that i still had a lil bit left. I went to Sacks Fifth Avenue La Mer counter, and they confirmed that this creme is not real. I will be asking for a refund, and also i am keeping a lil sample of this cream to send to La Mer company directly so they can deal with these sellers selling fake creams. It makes Amazon and La mer ( Estee Lauder) company look very bad. Please do not buy this product. Look around and you will see that there are a lot of people complaining that they have received a fake creme. This seller is not the only one that sells fake creams. There are more on Amazon.

After many several minutes of Baby Einstein branding logos and promos - you FINALLY get to the ACTUAL content of the video (however, not before even more logos and branding). And don't think you can just skip past this. They've inserted more corporate fluff into the content portion. If you're like us, you will be so annoyed by the video the first time watching it that you will never watch it again. My husband and I actually threw it away because we didn't feel good about GIVING it away! The little bit of content we did see was not very interesting and certainly not worth the wait. Better choice our opinion would be the Classical Baby series.",0

1838,"Please stop releasing this stuff.: It's recordings like this one that ruin the reputation an artist works to develop. Hendrix is the best guitarist ever in rock and roll and everybody feels that they need to make money off of him. This stuff is not really worth the price of the CD's it was pressed on. Too much of this stuff is out there and it is tarnishing the fact that Hendrix was a great songwriter, a good singer, and one heck of a guitarist. Please, do not buy this and maybe one day these cheap companies will realize that Hendrix fans want only the true stuff of Jimi and the Experience/Band of Gypsies.",0

I broke off both allen head driver bits immediately, the torx have held up well though. I have a $40 dewalt kit that is 80x nicer than this. Don't buy this kit.

But every time, he rises to the challenge to confound his critics and delight his fans. This album is a triumph of the first order.Never has Dylan sounded so world weary, or so wise. The lyrics are so honest, so humble, almost confessional. The music is eerily beautiful, in the best tradition of the blues. And Dylan's delivery proves that the medium is the message. The delicate phrasing and tonal shading only adds to the artistry. No one but Bob can sing with such poignancy and quiet power.Keep on keeping on, Bob!!",1
1844,inexpensive gun case solution: I have a few of these wrapping pieces I don't want to get scratched up in storage or on the way to the field. It will provide cushion for field piece.

1847,"My crock cracked, too: Agree with all comments. 1) Overall, the crock pot seems to function well. I have the stainless pot and beware, the outside gets incredibly hot. I make sure to keep it away from everything on the counter when I am cooking something; 2) The lid does not seat properly with the crock. This hasn't caused much of a problem and may even be the way it's designed. I have never had the liquid boil away even if the pot is on high all day; 3) My crock cracked after a year of use. To those who have observed that KitchenAid should stand behind it's product and replace the crock no questions asked, I agree. They should also redesign the darn crock so it doesn't crack and provide a free replacement since this is a well-documented issue. Some writers are on their third replacement for cryin' out loud!!

1851,"""Laundry Service"" shows Shakira's unique style: Shakira has succeeded in creating an innovative style that is unlike any other genre today. In her CD, ""Laundry Service,"" she mixes pop, Latin techniques, and even Arabic influences. In her song, ""Ojos Asi,"" she fuses Arabic lyrics and music with her own unique style to create a work that is not corny at all but rather one of the CD's best songs. Using a variety of instruments and rhythms, Shakira produces all of her own songs and lyrics. Her voice is part of her superb style. When she sings, her voice is completey real and her lyrics are even more genuine. This is something that most female ""sensations"" of today cannot say. She sings beautiful ballads in both English and Spanish. Three of her songs on this CD have become hits. Though not all of the songs on the CD are award winners, most are good and more than half are of superior quality.",1

One film (The Robot Fixer) actually has little to do with technology or ""robotics"" as we usually perceive it (Lets play, ""One of these films is not like the others""), while the others are very good speculative fiction pieces which make you go hmmm. I thought that Pak made the most use of his time and pulled the viewer into each story universe quite thoroughly.After a week of working 16 hour days in the astrodome after the Hurricane Katrina survivors came in, it was the perfect way to spend my first evening back with the family!

A lot of fluff and no meat. The ribbon that wraps this up in a ""don't do"" package is the fact that their customer service STINKS (anyone able to find a phone number?).

1857,How the Stars Fell into the Sky: A Navajo Legend: My son is in 2nd grade and they're doing a unit on Native Americans. We read this book together and enjoyed the story as well as the beautiful illustrations. This book also lends itself to do the shadowbox project that goes along with the class studies. I enjoyed the Navajo concept of how the stars are patterned in the sky. We would recommend this book for the 7-9 year old group.,1

The actress Nia may have been good in Greek Wedding but shes used up her goodwill. Basically she has this rule in the movie that she will only go out with a guy 5 times because she does not want to commit. Of course any movie that makes it seem like Nia is the hot one who every guy wants is all ready beyond belief. Basically Nia made this movie to make herself look good. If I can save one person from watching this movie I will have done my job. So to summarize this movie is awful and unenjoyable. plot is stupid characters are stupid everything is stupid.",0
1869,"A Neat Piece of History: The Church of England's first duty as an established church was to create a prayer book.

Be edict of Queen Elizabeth, a guidebook to Mass and the Administration of the Sacraments according to the church of England was created. This was the product of that edict. The Elizabethan language is absolutely beautiful. Imagine a living piece of testament to the protestant reformation right there beside you.

Drop them in the back and pull handle back. I'm thinking now, it's basicly the same movements but it seems easier. What the heck, it's easier then the older models. As far as breakdowns go? I've never had any with a reconditioned tool. I suggest, go for it.",1

Unfortunately, the professor requires A LOT of outside reading that we are expected to download and copy (wasting ink, paper, and the environment). Although there is required reading from this book, it is not the focus of her lectures. What I have read I find dry -- like a textbook! I am sure there are more interesting books that can be used for textbooks. I would not purchase this book to read for pleasure. On a positive note, it does cover most of the ethnic minority groups that we have in the United States. For a brief overview of each group, this book does cover the necessary information.",0

1877,"The Transcendence of Ignorance: Perhaps it's a consequence of living in a wealthy age, but we are once again awash in nonsensical confusions of science and metaphysics by people with an understanding of neither.This book, written by someone whose knowlege of both physics and metaphysics is limited to some superficial aspects gleaned from other sources, is typical of the genre. It requires very little thought, unlike serious physics or philosophy, and simply reinforces the notiion that all is one and none of it requires and study. Hence it's very attractive to those who are unwilling to deal with anything that isn't obvious or gleanable from television. Is all one? Yeah, sure. But that's no excuse to blow off Western science- or to think that a book like this says anything interesting about Eastern traditions.If you want physics, read physicists like John Gribben or Alan Guth. If you want Eastern metaphysics, read D.T. Suzuki. But stay away from these nonsensical attempts at fusion.",0
1878,"Thick and strong compactor bags: The only problem is that there are no holes at the top of the bag to anchor it to the compactor can. When the can starts getting full, the bag is pulled into the can. I fixed this by cutting 4 little slits near the top of the bag so I could attach the bag to the anchor buttons on the can.",1
1879,Wastes Gas No Control: I bought this to replace an 5 yr old model by the same company thinking it would have an improved flame and work better at angles. I wrongly assumed it would have the same settings control. I will return and look for a model that has setting controls. I use that for many purposes.,0
1880,Good product: I like the ease of installation of this ink cartridge and it's a lot cheaper than the HP printer ink I used to have to buy.,1
1881,"The spoiled leading the spoiled.: So we're supposed to get some sort of life changing experience watching rich people in New York raising spoiled brats? You give them everything they want, with almost no exceptions, and then wonder why they are entitled, spoiled, lazy and ungrateful? You don't teach them anything about the value of work, perseverance, and the value of a dollar until the age of 16-17 and THEN you want complain about ""how spoiled kids are""?

1882,"JOJ's best: Jack Off Jill is :( was a great band. This by far is their best album. BUT There's hope- not all is lost JESSICKA, ex lead singer of JOJ has a new band called scarling. that is even better then JOJ.I CAN FINALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT!www.scarling.com",1
1883,Good book!: It was decent. It was something along the lines of Stephen King but a little different. I bought the next novel in line so here's to looking for more hours of reading pleasure.,1
1884,"Waste of money: There is a lot of hype on the internet about these eye drops helping dissolve cataracts; they did not live up to any of the claims made about them. I have used over half of the product and there is no improvement whatsoever. They are sold as ""lubricant drops""...if this is what you want, you can get others for a lot less money!",0
1885,"Incredibly Poor Effort: Looking back on my years as an OPM fan, dating back to the release date of Menace to Sobriety...it is painful to have to sit and suffer through California Poppy and then convince myself that this is actually an OPM album. The style is so noticeably forced that it almost makes you tense rather than the ""soothing"" sound it obviously looks to achieve. Another huge downfall of this album is that it lacks any of the punky, funky and upbeat sounds that were so necessital and well-placed on earlier OPM endeavors; and also made them so memorable. I remember thinking that OPM signing with Suburban Noize Records was a promising leap forward in their career, but now I realize that it has pushed them down a road toward stoneristic stylings rather than the mutli-genre collectives that made their earlier albums so easy to replay. Save your money for the next OPM album down the road, because this one is simply not worth it, and is almost better forgotten than ever put in your cd player.",0
1886,"Defective: Looks great on paper--triple interface, respectable response time--if only is wasn't defective. FreeAgent Utility IDs it as defective--with RMA info, without any further explanation of why this is so. 1st hard drive I've owned--internal or external--that's defective out of the box.HD Tach reports absurdly slow stats--eSATA, Firewire (OK, 1394 in Windows-land)--no significant difference. So buyer beware, this ""premium"" priced external drive is only worth considering if it actually works. It doesn't, and to say I hate returning defective merchandise is an understatement.",0
1887,"Not worth buying: My son used this violin for about 6 months. Now I feel it is time to get him a new one. I bought it because it looks nice and provides some spare parts. Very soon, I realized why. One of the strings was broken very soon. The bridge was out of shape after 3 months. Most important, it does not stay in tune. My son's violin teacher told me that it is very difficult to tune it and suggest me to get it repaired.I brought it to a string store. The guy told me immediately:"" Did you get this online? It is not a good brand."" It would be at least $40 to repair it.I suggest you stay away from it.",0
1888,"Ulitmate Sacrifice blows this book away-not even close!: In addition to Gary Aguilar, it seems there are others who post favorable reviews because they are all enamored with Miss Mellen.

1889,"This...book has NOTHING to do with Cheese!!!!: I was severely disapointed. As a Canadian, we take our cheese very seriously. I saw the title, and thought perhaps it was a new type of suspense novel, about the rarely discussed 'cheese napping's'. Imagine my disgust when I found out that its a mediocre self help book.... and still.... NO CHEESE! This is false advertising. If you are looking for REAL information about cheese, seach the archives of the [url]",0
1890,"No Support for Windows XP: I used to like my Toshiba MEA-110 MP3 player. Sounded good. Small & convenient. The software, Toshiba Audio Manager, was a bit cumbersome, but ok once you got used to it. But now that I have a PC with Windows XP and discover that Toshiba offers no support for XP - no drivers to download, no upgrade for Audio Manager - I'm furious. A call to Toshiba tech support offered little more than a shrugged shoulder. I will likely never by a Toshiba product again, just for this reason. Every other peripheral I own is running nicely with XP because the manufacturer either made new software availalbe for download or because XP just handled it. But not Toshiba! And they don't seem to care. Nobody should buy this product.",0

If it's in this book, I couldn't find it.Repair doesn't get more basic than this.I'm still looking for a helpful chainsaw book.",0
1894,"Great book showing full product launch cycle: A must read for entrepreneurs. Gives great insight into how to launch a revolutionary product. Even for product manager, this book provides guidance on how to instigate a new product. Will recommend anyone interested in marketing new products. Now onto ""Inside Tornado""...",1

Charles Kay and Gayle Hunnicutt, take us to Russian court of protocol and apathy. Their performances make are poignant and truly believable of a fairytale gone wrong. Patrick Steward is Lenin in all his veracity and passion.Every child learning history, should see all 10 hours and 50 mesmerizing minutes.",0
1896,Space heater: This heater worked great through one winter of heavy use. Then the heating unit died. So now I have a fan that I don't need.,0
1897,"3EB Is The Best!!: 3EB is the best music group in the world! I listen to their CD at least once a day! Every song is great! My favroites include: Loosing A Whole Year, Semi-Charmed Life, How's It Going To Be, Thanks A Lot, Jumper, and Graduate!! It's not too heavy and not too lite - its just right!",1
1898,A beautiful book both inside and outside!: This is THE BEST devotional I've ever read. Each day I feel like Sarah Young wrote the words especially for me - I truly hear God speaking directly to me. Sarah Young has truly been anointed by God! I have given many of these books as gifts and everyone has expressed to me how this book has comforted and encouraged them throughout their days. This particular edition has the scripture passages written on the page right along with the daily devotional reading. That is very important to me ... that God's Word is incorporated into each devotional. I look forward to Jesus Calling me every morning!,1
1899,"space ghost: Ive been a big fan of space ghost for a while now and these dvd's are awsome! And its a pretty reasonable deal. Now, if youve never seen the show, you might want to borrow the dvd from someone or watch something like aqua teen hunger force (as the same geniouses wrote both masterpieces) And even if you do remember liking it, you might want to buy just one. But for you hardcore fans, this is most DEFINATLEY the way to go",1
1900,"Walking London: The only problem with this book is that one would have to live in London to have the time to do all 30 walks! The level of detail for the walks is just right - long enough to make it interesting, short enough that it can be read and followed while actually doing the walk. Each walk has a summary paragraph; the start and finish location with Underground and Bus information on how to reach that location; the length [distance]of the walk; the time required to do the walk; information on refreshments en route; and then the walk itself with a route map of the walk. For added flexibility, the map and commentary allow one to start/stop each walk at just about any point on the route. I teach an Insider's London class and recommend this book for both first-time and return visitors.",1
1901,"As an Engineer, I find this gizmo an insult to my profession: After 25 years making my living as a design engineer, I get very discouraged when I come across a product such as this which is so poorly designed.It does not do the job it is supposed to because of glaringly obvious design flaws: The teeth that are supposed to grip the nutmeg are too short and too blunt. The grater blade is cheaply made and grinds rather than shaves the nutmeg. The locking mechanism is awkward and hard to use. Save your money and buy a micro-plane grater.",0
1902,quality is awful.: No padding in feet just wire with a piece of flimsy material over it. Not happy with this at all.,0
1903,Awful. Way too quick drying.: My girlfriend and I have tried 4 of these and we haven't gotten one to work yet. It either dries too quickly or clumps and wont hold.,0
1904,junk did not work most of the time: I would not recommend anyone waste your money on this product it doesn't work most of the time.,0
1905,Paramount sucks: The Odd Couple is one of the greatest sitcoms ever. I have purchased every season more than once and have literally wore the discs out. The episodes never get old. Paramount on the the other hand sucks for their musical edits I consider it Sacrilege what they've done to this series and others like Happy Days. Originally Paramount didn't want to release the Odd Couple. Time Life released a perfect set of season 1 completely unedited. They also had commentary completed for the other seasons. When season one sold well Paramount changed their minds and released the other seasons with edits and without the commentary Time Life also released a complete series boxset for Get Smart everything intact. The man responsible for this was going to do the same for the Odd Couple until the jerks from Paramount decided to release their butchered sets. I'm not telling you to boycott this series. I'm only telling you what Paramount does with their produsts,1
1906,"Over-rated nonsense: Just finished watching this and I hated it. I normally like Grant and Hepburn, but here they have little or no chemistry and little in the way of direction. A fairly promising beginning decends into an unfunny mess. The plot is non-existent. The script is worse and the over-acting is idiotic and just embarrassing. (Barry Fitzgerald was never funny anyway.)An undeserved reputation.",0

1908,"works, but not well: I bought this product to staple a quarter inch oak back board to a couple projects I'm building. The stapler shoots staples out fine, but they won't penetrate quarter inch oak ply wood. This stapler would probably work well for apolstry.Also when I received the stapler with the machine oil, the machine oil was packaged open and half of it had squeezed out all over the place in transit. I didn't have to worry about oiling the stapler that was soaked on arrival. What a mess!",0
1909,"Excellent!: The definitive guide to all that is Hanson. If you love their music, their antics, or just their music, you will love this book. Heck, even if you hate the music you might like the book. Mr. Gollihare has a rare gift for writing.",1

1911,"Promotes bad dietary habits: While we certainly do not know everything there is to know about all the effects of eating certain foods, there are foods known (proven) to cause serious health problems if consumed liberally. This book, in many cases, promotes eating such foods as staples in given diets. In my honest opinion, the book is irresponsible since it does not point out the possible negative effects of following the bad diets it promotes. The book was, however, interesting reading -but- (again - in my opinion) should be sold as fiction.",0
1912,"Happy but wanting more...: My purchased this item for my 76 year old Father. He is VERY pleased with the DVD. However,it is mostly ""conversation"" and hardly any music. I was under the impression with the summarization I had read...there were ""over (20) of Willie's biggest hits included""...maybe by mention...not by play. The DVR is approx 60 minutes long. Like I said...for the most part he is very happy with the DVR...as the ""Purchaser""...I was wishing for more.",1
1913,"A Terrible Disaster: This movie could not be worse. Trite, annoying, confusing, and most of all boring beyond reason. I have enjoyed Shymalan's previous films, each of the last four - but this is ridiculous. Stay away from it. I am grateful to myself that I didn't spend money to see it in the theater.",0
1914,LEGO'S?: This kit and the Helicopter kit is the worse Lego building sets we have ever gotten.There are so many warped pieces that it can not even be put together.The Helicopter goes together but does not stay.They are very hard to build and impossible to play with as you are always putting them back together.Very disappointed and i do not know how to get my money back with the box destroyed and pieces are loose.I can not believe the poor quality of these kits.It is not something you expect from Tonka or LEGO.,0
1915,"Author Loves His Book: In the mid-70s, I produced and recorded a two-day conference for entrepreneurs featuring numerous experts including bankers, accountants, venture capitalists, marketing consultants, successful business owners, etc. as speakers. Subsequently, I transcribed the recordings and edited the resulting manuscript. Winning the Money Game (WTMG) is the result. I now make my living as an author-editor and needed a copy of WTMG to send to a prospective client for whom I propose to perform the same service since he recently produced a multi-speaker conference. Since its publication, WTMG has sold tens-of-thousands of copies and was reprinted by a division of Prentice Hall in the early 80s. For obvious reasons, I highly recommend this book. Don Dible",1
1916,"Addicted....: ....to this fabulous series, and Season 1 kicks it into high gear right out of the box!

1917,"I received it dirty!: I ordered this item using my friend's amazon account because that time I don't have an account here. When the item arrived, I've noticed that it has a lot of dust on it and it's dirty especially the plastic package that comes with it. It seems its not brand new as what it was advertised here. Also, the velco of this in the arms separated from each other after a few times of wearing while I'm checking its fit.",0

1919,"Crappy Product. Does NOT Work!: This product is junk just like all the other cellulite creams on the market. It does NOT work. Save your money. I am slim and have minimal cellulite. I exercise and eat right and the product did not make one once of difference in my cellulite. The patches are a joke too and you only get a few in a box and they are supposed to be used regularly with the gel over several weeks. You'd be out of alot of money fooling with this. There is no cure for cellulite. If there were, all of the rich and famous people who have money for expensive cosmetic treatments would not have it!",0
1920,"Two great games: Final Fantasy Anthology features Final Fantasy (FF) V and VI. These games were originally for the Super Nintendo, however they were adapted for Playstation 1.Final Fantasy V is a game with 4 characters and uses what many RPG players may know as the ""job class"" system. In other words, the character can be a knight, monk, or ninja, specializing in skills unique to each class. The magic is bought in stores, which I don't necessarily like, but the game itself is solid.Final Fantasy VI is a game where the job classes are somewhat ""built in,"" and the game features at least 12 playable characters. The jobs are built in, because each character has unique ""job commands."" Locke has a ""steal"" command, Terra can do magic early in the game where it is not readily available. The plot is really good in this FF game, and it is easily in my personal top 5 of video games I've ever played.This is a great collection and I encourage any vintage RPG lover to try it out.",1

1924,"A true ""sleep aid"" if there ever was one: I have tried every over the counter sleep aid along with breathing exercises and meditation--this is the only thing that has ever worked in terms of falling and staying asleep. The best part of melatonin is that it ACTUALLY takes you through the STEPS of falling asleep instead of just knocking you out like Unismom or Nyquil (i.e., you actually start to feel yourself shutting down and know it's time to sleep). For someone that has struggled w/ sleeplessnes and the resultant exhaustion from my late-teens and into my mid-20s, melatonin is a time saver and has improved the quality of my sleep dramatically.",1
1925,"The Mobiles part falls off: I bought this mobile for my daughter, and to my suprise today while she was napping the mobile actually fell on tops of her while she was asleep. It was hooked up correctly, as it has never done this in the 4 months we have had it. As a parent, I would consider finding a mobile that is strong,one that doesn't just turn and snap into place, and will not fall on top of an infant. As a result my daughter has a welt on her forehead. As for the music, one would think that they would have put some well known songs from the composers, not some lesser known ones.",0
1926,"Only good for drivers: We returned this very thin volume almost immediately. It is essentially a road atlas for Egypt, and doesn't give any other information at all. If we'd been planning to drive out in the desert, this would have been great to have. We weren't.",0
1927,"Followed by Helen Caldicott: Peter Huber was on C-Span 2 last Sunday. He lets us know that $50 oil will not last since oil can be produced from Canadian sands for $20. It should be amusing to follow this prediction. Is he unaware of net energy questions and EROEI? He was followed by three hours of Dr. Helen Caldicott which believe it or not, was easier to take.",0
1928,"Good, reliable solution: I bought a printer from bestbuy not knowing that one doesn't come with printer cable. After finally figuring it out, I came to the one place where i go when i need things in a hurry (thanks to my Prime membership), Amazon. After doing a quick search which yielded a few options, I decided to go with Belkin, a reputed manufacturer of cables and other computer, audio, and video accessories. This cable has worked really well for me over the past couple of months and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable USB cable.",1

However, I was hoping there would be some incentive for the owners of the original Kindle to upgrade through a partial trade in or discount offer especially since the purchase of Kindle 2 will replace the use of Kindle 1 for most of us.As original Kindle owners we provided essential feedback that influenced the development of Kindle 2. We also were instrumental in word of mouth advertising for the product. We also paid a high price for the Kindle 1 which does only a fraction of what the upgrade does.I'm sure many Kindle 1 owners would like to remain loyal customers but at the cost of nearly another $400, may not be able to buy a second Kindle.Surely Amazon must appreciate the users and customers who have been their strongest advocates and providers of feedback. Why not give them an incentive to buy the Kindle 2?",1
1932,"You're a wonderful human being.: Canceled my order. I just can't bear to watch Han Solo step on Jabba then get away with it and then call him a wonderful human being (or a close approximation). It's a stupid, redundant scene with no new exposition. It looks ugly. And it steals drama from ROTJ. I'm just not going to give George any more money until he edits this stuff out. I don't have to have the absolute originals. I like some of the digital touch-ups. But every single bit of dialog he added since 1997 should be trashed.And one more thing. Why is he continually changing the original trilogy to match the crud he delivered in the prequels. That's just plain dumb. If Star Trek II could survive Kahn's recognizing Checkov who wasn't on the Enterprise when he was, then the original trilogy could have survived the plot holes between it and the prequels.Uggh!",0

1940,"Komeda = great music, production, emotion, fun...: When I heard ""What Makes It Go"" upon its release in America, I was so impressed that it redefined my thoughts on music. I was amazed at the high production value and the talent in the band. I have heared ""What Makes It Go"" so many times that I can just play back the entire album in my head and feel just as great about it. With the release of this collection in America, I am happy to hear the words in Swedish, as it allows the vocals to be more of an instrument and allows me to appreciate the talent of Komeda even more.",1
1941,"Yes--and Another One for the Road: As an experienced investor who has read a lot of financial books, people often ask me what's the best book for learning how to invest in stocks. The answer: One Up On Wall Street. It's clear, engaging, smart, and geared to the beginner (there's plenty in here for experienced investors too). Follow its advice and it will be one of the better investments you'll ever make. Another excellent book that I've been recommending a lot lately is The Mindful Money Guide. The Mindful Money Guide supplements Lynch's book really well by offering a comphrensive and emminently sane approach to personal finance (stock investing is also covered). It too is well-written, wise, and fun to read.",1
1942,"Pleasant, mild, sweet: This is a nice, lightly-flavored, not too sweet coffee. The Caramel Vanilla Cream (also Green Mountain, also in a K-cup) is definitely rounder in flavor and stronger on the vanilla notes, but this is a pleasant, nice coffee. Not too strong.",1
1943,"If you could only see how little talent we have!: That should be the name of this album. Granted they have about four good songs on this album, and in this case I use the word album loosely, but the rest of the songs are pure CRAP!! I had hoped for a better effort after I had first heard their song If You Could Only See the way She Loves me on the radio but I am GREATLY disappointed. I won't even bother trying to sell this one to a used CD store for fear some other misguided soul may actually accidently purschase it, god only knows how this crap might damage them. After listening to this crap I need some tonic to get over it.",0

1945,"A Promising Debut Indeed.: It looks like this year will be a very good year for good soul music. This brother's voice reminds me of Luther Vandross on a hip-hop vibe. This brother can straight up sing! I would say the current single, ""Could it Be"" maybe one of the weaker cuts on this very strong CD. Cuts to look out for are ""Happiness,"" ""Looking for Love,"" ""Heaven in your eyes,"" ""Ready, Willing, and Able,"" and ""Waiting on you."" He slips a little bit by including some rap on some songs but for the most part, this brother shows that there is hope for R&B music. Those brothers who can't sing (U know who they are) need to step aside because a real singer is in the house!",1
1946,"Way too small: My daughter is only 4 years old and her head circumference is at about 25%, which translates to the average head size of a 3-year-old. The swimming cap was way too small and gave her headache. It should be called ""infant"" rather than ""junior"" swimming cap. To give it some credit, the material feels nice and the color matches that on the screen. However, it may only work for a doll.",0
1947,A sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline: Absolutely dreadful compared to Lenny's 1960's Copland recordings on Columbia (now Sony). His 1960's Copland recordings are monumental. Avoid all his later Deutsches Gramophone dreck. These are only a sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline. Used copies for sale for 27 cents should tell you something.,0
1948,"Incomplete: The first order came without the screws, instructions, and other hardware so I called and had the order resent to me. The second shipment arrived without one piece of hardware but I could make do temporarily. I called the company and asked for the cross member I was missing and they said they would send it out immediately. It's been weeks and I'm still waiting.

1949,"A gifted writer, but needs more seasoning: Being a fan of his TV show on the Food TV Network, I hungered for more of Anthony Bourdain's crude wit and harsh tell-it-as-it-is personality. Kitchen Confidential starts out with pure Bourdain attitude and fed my hunger satisfactorily. However, the latter half of his tell-all tale of the restaurant biz fell apart with random stories which don't tie together well with the book overall. Despite the roughness and poor editing of the book, I found it to be an enjoyable read. Bourdain does a good job telling his self-aggrandizing life story, but leaves out his wife almost entirely!

1950,Patch Adams is a great movie!: I saw this movie in the theaters and I enjoyed every minute of it. It's one of my favorite Robin Williams movie. Everytime when it comes on Starz I always watch it. This movie is not boring at all it's a good movie. I think for those of ya'll who hadn't seen it should watch it because I think it's great.,1
1951,"Bland, uninspiring effort: ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" was a great comeback for U2, and their first consistently good effort since ""Rattle and Hum"". Unfortunately, the comeback didn't last long -- ""How to Dismantle An Atom Bomb"" is stale, formulaic U2-lite, rendered by a band that seemingly has run out of ideas. Even the return of Steve Lillywhite as U2's producer fails to spark any magic. Oh, for the days of ""War"" and ""The Joshua Tree"".",0
1952,"awesome cd: I used to listen to BUSH when my brother would play it. I always liked the song ""glycerine"" it's awesome, and so is ""comedown"". I really liked this cd a lot. It's like so cool.",1
1953,Poor pump for pool cover application: Bought this unit in the fall of 2009. Worked great over the winter. Ceased to operate in Jan 2011. Way too much to spend for fewer than two seasons.,0

1957,"Hawaii LOST!: As with the other reviews I have read on this DVD version, what a disappointment seeing this film has been. Waiting for years for the DVD to come out and it has lost almost 30 minutes. Missing are the Overture, Entracte and Exit Music but a very crucial confession given by Abner to Jerusha that ends Act 1. It is very unfortunate that I will have to keep the VHS tape which contains the original Widescreen version of the film.Please write to MGM and telll them how diappointed fans of this film are and encourage them to release a Special Edition of this wonderful film. I am a little worried how they will cut the soon to be released titles-Grand Prix and Ryan's Daughter. Just keep your fingers crossed that wiser minds will prevail other than those who chose to release this poor version of a great Film.",0
1958,Another lost sale due to failed marketing strategy...: I came to Amazon to buy (pre-order) this trilogy on Blu-Ray today and then I read the information in the reviews alleging market manipulation by the studio on the content of these disks.So I didn't buy it.,0
1959,"hard to put down!!!!: i buy all of sandra brown's books with out reading the cover so i know nothing fo the plot when i start reading.. this one had me hooked from the first chapter. the book within the book was something new..just when you think you have it solved,you find out through an amazing twist you were totally wrong.too bad ""the vanquished"" is not a real book sounds like my kind of story. another great one from sandra brown.",1
1960,"Terrible- Not like the other ones!!: Please this DVD is very, very bad! When I saw the cover I thought is was going to be good. But when My child saw ths he Fell asleep!! The Engines do not look roght and they move very differently! Also the the opening where it says Thomas & Freinds-What??? That's not the song! Please I really am telling you DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! IT IS HORRIBLE:(!!",0
1961,"Don't insult such a great novel by reading the Cliff Notes: I'm in complete agreement with hobbes. I mean, c'mon, how long can it possibly take to read a hundred pages?!? The Cliff Notes are nearly as long! Night is an amazing, brilliant novel, pure art; get the real thing.",0
1962,"Works, but sounds like crap: just like others have said, the crackling / gain / overdrive distortion on this thing is AWFUL... Better than no sound, but not by much.Pay a bit more for the 7.1 version. I ordered both and it sounds crystal clear.",0
1963,"Wrong Tracks, Amazon!: I once owned this great album on vinyl. The description on Amazon looks great -- everything one would want from a Spinners CD. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found a completely different CD than the one pictured and advertised online (even though the product codes match exactly). I sent the CD back to Amazon (no problem) but I'm disappointed Amazon still has it listed incorrectly online more than a year later.",0
1964,A fun counting book: I have never been disappointed with a Bill Martin book & this one is no different. A fun counting book.,1

1967,"Ok read: I had a hard time staying interested. Too much jumble. Plot was ok, but not enough to recommend to friends.",1
1968,English Please: I just bought 3 CD's for gifts after hearing Il Divo on several TV shows this week. They sang in English and why would I not expect their CD to be in English also? No one said it would not be in English and not a word on Amazon that it was not in English. The music is beautiful - but I would appreciate being able to understand the lyrics. Very disappointing!,0
1969,Bad Battery: I ordered this battery for a Motorola Razor phone.When the battery finally arrived I installed it in the Razor V3 and the phone screen said INVALID BATTERY.,0
1970,"Ruins book - uninspired movie: We love the Stellaluna book and this DVD completely veers from the tone and warmth of the book's story. It was a major disappointment. The movie guts the story, introduces the baby birds as snarky, adds terrible characters (a spider that wants to be a superhero and some tropical birds who want to make Stellaluna into something she's not) and has completely unneccessary ""scary"" parts. I say scary with some qualifications - our kids are sensitive to such things and many of our friend's kids would not find this scary. It also has the owl continually threatening to eat/harm the baby birds and Stellaluna as a subplot. This movie is not worth anyone's time. There are so many movies that are much better.",0
1971,Entertaining: Is this a first time novelist you could never tell. This novel was well written and put together. Can't wait for her next one. CHEERS to Sungee,1
1972,"american slut: she was dancing and singing her brand new song ""dirrty"" in a exclusive London club very badly. After she drank eight glasses of russian Vodka, then she ran away to the stage & started to stand on the table and started to sing and dance.the alcohol impact was unfortunately too strong for Tina, that's why she laid down on stage, cause she was unable to finish her song. Her husband Jordan had slipped her away & brought her on his shoulder.....Dirrty and Dirrty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
1973,"brutal!: I'm not a big fan of black/death metal, though I probably have several dozen CDs that fit that category. This is the first Emperor album I've heard, and it's as brutal as a beating by soccer hooligans on steroids, yet the musicianship keeps it from becoming a monotonous pounding (a pitfall which too many bands are prey to), so that one can actually distinguish between individual songs. I've docked it one star, mainly because I'm not a fan of growl-type vocals.",1
1974,"Awesome Pichi Music!: This Vocal Collection of Mermaid Melody is totally worth buying! It has not only the full tracks of your favorite mermaid princess's singing, it also has the TV cut opening and closing songs of the 1st season. And also totally awesome is the tracks of the mermaids singing for the GBA game. Also, if you can read Japanese, there are lyrics for every song. Enjoy!",1
1975,"Razzle Dazzle Me!: Wonderful sound track! Anyone, who enjoyed the movie, will certainly relive the experience listening to the CD. I cannot wait for the DVD to be released in August.",1
1976,"DVD-ROM DOES NOT WORK!: Me and my dad got this movie from the library. I finished watching the movie and the bonus features. I went to DVD-ROM. What happens? DVD-ROM DOES NOT WORK! I tried my DVD Player. DOES NOT WORK! Tried my family's computer. DOES NOT WORK! The DVD worked fine. When i looked on the back of the DVD, i found out that it was made in 2002.

1977,"Calphalon from China: Perhaps the fact that this item, along with a number of other ones in the current Calphalon line-up, is Made in China will turn some purists off. Their loss. I've not been able to find anything to complain about. Hard-anodized aluminum is no longer a new idea, and if off-shore production doesn't offend your sense of moral nationalism (nationalistic morality?), snap this stuff up. It's fabulous cookware, and represents exceptional value.",1
1978,"EDUCATIONAL: There is a lot of explanatory speech in CD. I was hoping to listen to bird sounds and relax when I ordered this. But all series of Birding by ear from PETERSON field guides are with speech. Actually it has the name guides, so I don't blame the product.If you need to analyze and study bird sounds all series of ""Peterson"" are ideal for you.If you want to relax listenning to the bird sounds, mixed with nature sounds like rivers, waves and rain, then you should check products from DON GIBSON (like bird morning songs or SACD-Surround Audio CD symphony).",1
1979,"The Truth About Demons: When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a bit corney and unrealistic. The Demon ""followers"" looked like a bunch of freaks.Just a bunch of ravers gone wrong. But as the mystery began to unfold I was pulled in. I wasn't used to seeing Karl Urban in a role like this since I've only see him play tough guys. But He pulled it thru as always. I thought the film was ok. The storyline was lacking a bit and the ending was ambigous. The only thing that I found distasteful was the uncalled for sex scene. But hey it's a horror movie.",0
1980,"Beautiful: Almost everything Nicola Griffith writes is beautiful and powerful. This was no exception. A flowing descriptive narrative, sometimes terrifying, always overwhelming of each character in each story, in her circumstances.",1
1981,Was Hoping for Better: I was hoping this C.D. would be better then it is. Track #2 is the best song on the C.D. I LOVE the vocals and the bass work. If the other songs on this C.D. were even remotely close to track #2 I would have been in heaven. As it is I'm still waiting in purgatory.,0
1982,PUBLIC SECRETS: A good read. At times I could not put it down. Good to read on plane/train/bus or on holidays thanks,1
1983,"There are better books if you are thinking about an affair: I breezed through this book in about 90 minutes. There are three worthwhile chapters: Mistakes, Masters, and Contemporary Affairs. The other 30 percent of the book is entertaining, but not particularly enlightening. The cartoons did not add anything to the content. If you are contemplating an affair, the author provides some good common sense rules of thumb (don't leave receipts for sexy lingerie lieing around) but does not provoke thought or insight. This book is more suitable in the bathroom of a single person for entertainment, than as a reference. It was the first one that came up on my search, and the first one I read on the subject. I have since ordered two more in hopes of something more substantive.",0
1984,"Love Earths Best: I really love Earths Best, and have used only EB to feed my little one. This cereal is great, except I would switch back to plain flavor after this box is done. The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby. So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much.",1

Should have known it would not last. It stopped working today. Just like that--stopped working. The coffee side gave problem right when we purchased it. But I did not care about the coffee. I bought it for the cappuccinos. I cleaned it routinely, descaled it and everything.After half hour on the phone, they told me another company's name and address to ship to them. I have to ship it at my own cost! It will take 3 weeks to fix. Don't know if it is worth repairing.Will not buy DeLongi products again!I read the reviews right after I purchased the item on Amazon.

1987,"Well Done Michael Caine. Merry Christmas!: This Amazon Instant Video [purchased December 22, 2012] includes ""With a Grateful Prayer and a Thankful Heart,"" but does not include ""When Love Is Gone."" This version was released in 1992 and runs 1 hour 26 minutes. The 1938 Reginald Owen version does not include the scene where Belle learns that Ebeneezer loves money more than her, then calls off their engagement. The 1951 Alastair Sim version depicts Ebeneezer's former fiancee as working with the homeless during the present Christmas time.My family and I watched The Muppet Christmas Carol on VHS when it was first distributed. We enjoy the Instant Video version, too.It includes ""The Love We Found."" At the movie's conclusion Ebeneezer echoes and expands Tiny Tim's ""God bless us,"" to ""God bless us everyone.""""Nice story Mr. Dickens""""Oh, thanks. If you liked this, you should read the book.""",1
1988,"Very Dissapointing: I hate to be critical, but I have been looking for really good, fun workout tapes. THis one was not it. THe price was excellent, but no workout whatsoever. It was fun to learn some dance moves, but I spent tons of time rewinding because the cueing was awful, and the instructions were minimal. My heart rate barely rose. Sorry to say, but I wouldnot recommend this to anyone, unless you were trying to learn a few, very few, modern dance steps.",0
1989,"Wow, this book is bad.: The writing style is so high-school. The dialogue is something you'd see on ""Gossip Girl"" or ""90210."" The only reason I finished it was to see what happens to the moronic main character.The plot, corporate espionage, is ok, but not the way Mr. Finder handled it. He made it banal and trivial.If you're into books that kill time while you're doing laundry, get this one.",0
1990,"DISAPPOINTING: I ENJOYED THE PRIOR BOOKSIN THIS SERIES VERY MUCH. I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE COMPLEX PLOTS AND SUB-PLOTS. AFTER KEEPING THEM GOING FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE HOW THEY ARE ALL RESOLVED IN THIS VOLUME IN SUMMARY FASHION, AS IF THE AUTHOR BECAME TIRED OF THEM. THE RESOLUTIONS WERE UNSATISFACTORY AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF MOSES AND THE EXODUS WAS INACCURATE AND OFFENSIVE.",0
1991,"Clever, Entertaining ... and Hard-Hitting: It's easy to see why Michael Moore makes certain people SO uncomfortable - he tells the truth! At one point in the film, Moore is told by a Wall Street executive: ""Don't make any more movies!""Yeah - fortunately for the rest of us, another of his masterpieces is hopefully right around the corner. Go, Michael! ;-)",1
1992,"Fantastic insight and teaching.: It's hard to beat A.W. Tozer for Bible teaching. All of his books are so insightful and this is one of the best. Tozer goes so much deeper than most of those preaching from the pulpit. As a long time Christian I am amazed at the things I never heard discussed before. In this book, he takes us into topics such as God the Incomprehensible, The Eternity of God, The Wisdom of God, God's Omnipresence, The Faithfulness of God and a host of other topics. If you are looking for deeper insight into God, this is the book for you. Tozer's teaching is great and I am confident you will learn much and really enjoy this book.",1
1993,"Not much remains: Very predictable. Author too self-congratulatory about her professional strivings, her rags-to-riches arrivism, and her own endurance as next-of-kin during a cancer struggle. We learn much of her infatuation with JFK Jr. & Carolyn Bessette and almost nothing of the personality of the dying young husband or the marriage beyond vacations and access to privilege. For a widow memoire, look to Joan Dideon.",0
1994,"Sheet ripped right after being purchased.: I love the pattern on this sheet, and it matches my son's room perfectly. However, the quality is awful! It ripped all around the sheet right after being washed for the 1st time. All we were doing is putting it on a standard crib mattress, but it still shredded. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. Too bad, because I do love the looks of it.",0
1995,Customer Service: I actually love the vacuum. Something happened unexpectedly that the vacuum suction is not working properly and is still under warranty. I've tried feverishly to contact customer service and to date I still have not gotten good information. If you read this and you know a direct contact to customer service please put it out there. Thanks in advance.,1
1996,"Sleeper: This movie was a sleeper, in that it put me to sleep and I had to go back and re watch some scenes I missed. Don't bother, even though the DVD cover is kind of cool. There are no characters in this film worth caring about and the plot is stupid...The idea sounded great, but this film turned it into stupid. The acting was stiff...bad...horrible. Just bout any movie made for the Sci Fi channel is as good or better than this.",0
1997,"Excellent product but excessive shipping cost: The product is excellent but the shipping cost is exhorbitant, costing almost as much as the product. I ordered two thinking it would lower shipping, but shipping was charged for both,",1
1998,Barry Whites Greatest!: A great compilation of Barry Whites' greatest. Stunning orchestral arrangements that blended popular music to the incredible beauty of so many different instruments which allow the emotions his music creates to soar into the grandness of his presentation. He had such a broad range of talent. His wonderful voice presents us with the deep richness any woman would love to be sung to with; but he also sings the lyrics with feelings that leads you to believe he understands the emotions he is singing about. The songs included are truely his greatest selections and they are just as I remember when I first heard them a long time ago!,1

Will never buy a Maxtor again.UPDATE: I removed the drive from the casing and put it in another USB drive case and it works perfectly. Seems like these drives have faulty USB components which fail over time. If you don't know this, you'll end up sending it to Maxtor for their ""repair service"" which costs $700 plus. If you have a dead drive out of warranty, you're better off trying it in another case before sending it in. You might have the same luck as me.",0

2003,"Wonderful uplifting reminder of the simple things in life: Geologist and writer Rick Bass muses about time and natural processes, both human and geological, creating a metaphorical experience for the reader. In his journal, he tells each anecdote with lyrical descriptions, but then goes one step beyond with some illumination about love, living, human beings, even existence itself. At this point, the body of the text becomes a secondary experience as the reader begins to feel the truth in his 'illuminations.' Many entries make the reader laugh out loud while others will instill the deep impulse to go hug a loved one. This book will make anybody remember how lovely life really is.",1
2004,"Walk Slowly: Okay, so visually stunning and semi cool story but the gameplay is half awesome, half completely retarded. The alternate name should be ""Walk Slowly"". You spend half the game walking at a snails pace trying to avoid having people bump into you so guards don't come after you. That is literally half the game and it's retarded. You'll finish a mission and have to spend 20 minutes walking like a turtle hoping no one bumps you to get it saved.It's as fun as it sounds. Whatever designer thought that was a good idea should be fired. It completely ruins what would otherwise be a great game.",0
2005,"Excellent Synthesizer/Pop Music: I bought this CD because my friend had it and I couldn't stop listening to it. Even though it appears that this guy is essentially making the music in his basement studio, you wouldn't know it from listening to it.

2006,"A book for a cozy evening by the fire: I have been enjoying the Ann Purser books this interminable winter in Montana. Be sure to read this book first in this series, the characters all reappear, which I really love, and for those who enjoy Sybil Marshall's books of rural England, or the Miss Read books here is another good writer who enjoys the slow pace of village life. There is a villainess to beat all in these books, a relentless old bag who never stops spying and interfering. Bonnie",1

2008,Tripe: I have read previous Robinson books and they were ok but this story is absurd. To believe that a major in the SAS would become a arab terrorist and to hide a boat in the Panama Canal when there are millions of square miles of ocean to hide it is stretching the imagination.I have read many cheaper books that were miles better than this.I don't think I will read any more Robinson books. Don't waste your money.,0
2009,"Whine, whine, whine . . .: If you like a lot of whiny, introspective characters, then this book is for you; there's not a happy one in the bunch. Ms. Trollope is a skilled writer, no fault there, but nothing could compensate for this depressing storyline. I was almost to the end when I realized I had better things to do with my time; I put it down and didn't finish it. I so disliked these characters, I just didn't care what happened to them.",0

2018,"Great Toning Workout: Tamilee Webb delivers a great toning workout for the buns in this tape. Like the other ""I Want Those..."" tapes, there are two workouts, each complete with warm-up and cool downs. The first workout is a bit easier than the second (although they both burn) and when you advance a bit you can do both. And there is little repetition between the two so you won't get bored. Webb is a confident and professional instructor. She does NOT have that (seemingly requisite)ear to ear grin glued to her face, which makes her seem more genuine. There is really no cardio work here, and my only gripe is that this should have been more clear on the tape jacket. But it will last as a great toning and strengthening bun workout",1
2019,"Mediocre: I don't think this product works very well. Then again, I have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies. So maybe it is just me.

Its just a vibrator if you ask me, but if you are thinking about easing or relaxing your back FORGET IT. I am surprised to see people's praise for this product, seriously I advice that you try one of those expensive chair massagers or better go to a chiropractor and then maybe you will redefine the meaning of phrase ""back relief"". If this product relieves you of anything its your dollars (although not much).",0

2023,"Poor product: I have owned two Cuisinart products. One was a coffee maker that ground beans and brewed coffee. Great concept, but the grinder always got stuck in the coffee maker. I would have to use pliers and screwdrivers to pry it out. I tried to grease the grinder- nothing worked. I threw away the coffee maker.Today, I used my Cuisinart blender's food processor for the first time. The chopping blade is now stuck half way inserted into the preparation bowl and will not come out. Nor will it go on. Nothing will dislodge the blades, and I cannot use the food processor. This is exactly the same problem.Long story short- I can recommend staying at the Cuisinart Spa in Anguilla in the West Indies, but I cannot recommend any kitchen products made by them.",0

2026,"Great for teaching turn-play: This is a good toy to teach your child turn-play. The quality of the material is okay. There are extra cherries now in the box(there were negative reviews in the past about this). The size is right, the colors are vibrant, durability is just fine. But again, its value comes from its easiness to teach turn-play. Children gave a better reaction to waiting and taking turns while playing Cherry-O when compared to playing with Candyland. A little pricey but all similar toys are around this price.",1

After a satisfying resolution of the cliffhanger with Blaine the Mono, Roland et al resume their quest for the Dark Tower.Around a campfire, with a mysterious castle looming ahead, Roland spins a story of his first love and it is this tale which forms the lions share of the novel. With humor, his fine understanding of the pain of adolescence, and his incredible sense of story, King compells us to read on and uncover one layer of the complex persona which is Roland.This is a great read. You are left in the exact right place -- wanting more - eager for more - demanding more. Dear SK please hurry!",1

It's similar to vinyl placemats.Since I can't rate by half stars here, I would take off only half a star for this same fact, as I occasionally need to lift my mouse and get my pointer again.

The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a ""Did you get it?"" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks.",0

First of all, the outer metal shell is very delicate and prone to denting, thereby putting its ""slickness"" to a quick end. Secondly, the setting controls are not obvious nor conveniently located, especially if you are fumbling around in a darkened room and half asleep. Thirdly, and most importantly, it is unreliable. A significant amount of the time, the alarm does not come on even though all display indicators suggest that it is set correctly.For $60, you can find a much better unit than this one.",0

Now to take a look at how some trilogy films had great endings lets think of a few ... hmm the matrix with its other scripts already around i hear they shall be excellent and that had a brilliant ending did it not it allowed for sequel yet had a very major event in it. alien had a resonalbe ending although the next 2 films were feeble in comparision but that is not fault of the original. this film did have an excuse it could not change too much as then it would be too unlike the series and comic but where are the expendible charachters who they chose to edit, the film however has good special effects and would probably please a fan of it but possibly not the more discerning viewer",0

2050,"This book stinks like kitty litter: As a cat lover, with 12 indoor only cats I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I ended up irate that this man thinks he knows cats well enough to write about them. He seems to have only lived with them a year and even gave one of his five away at one point. When I take an animal in, it us mine for the lifetime of the animal regardless of behavior or any other problem. I also believe as most intelligent people do that cats should be kept indoors only. Yes, they may get a little bored, but it is the owner's job to find new ways to stimulate them. A beach in New Zealand may be fairly safe for cats, but you never know when they could get into poison or near an animal abuser. If you want to know about the emotional lives of cats just watch and enjoy them.",0
2051,"261 pages of Americana: This is a fun read. Newbie author Glenn Gaslin takes loving aim at the wonders of America, while poking fun at absurd cultural institutions like monster SUVs, militant gated communities, ... boy bands, giant convenience-store beverages and the emerging, soon-to-be-dominating power of the next generation.The story centers around Beemer Minutia, a young man alternately living and hunting for the American Dream. All he wants to do is drive and discover, but he's willing to settle down for love. As long as it's in the biggest, most extreme housing development ever.For the record, my favorite lines are:""Ask him what kind of name's that: Beemer.""""Hey, what kind of name's that?""""German.""The story if fun and the cover is pretty.

It's so bad it's funny. To think someone could make this movie and expect people to actually enjoy it. Throughout the whole movie, it's like they're pussyfooting around to get to the good stuff (which there was none). There were quite a few CG effects that looked like they were done by a child. Very dissapointed in it. Do yourself a favor and save your money and use it towards the version with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Seeing Dakota's performance in it was worth the money alone. I saw it twice in theatre and enjoyed every bit of it. It had me talking for months",0

2065,"Pete Still Has Passion: This joyful celebration of Townshend's catalogue, both Who and solo, reminds me of the days when live albums were live albums --- featuring extended and loose versions of the studio tracks. The extra length is not always a blessing, but this project works because of the superb musicanship and especially because of Townshend's obvious joy in performing this mixture of the predictable (Magic Bus; Won't Get Fooled Again) and the pleasantly surprising (Now and Then, A Little Is Enough). Worth the price of admission for that chilling moment in Anyway Anyhow Anywhere when he sings ""This is what we used to believe/ We thought we would live forever."" But dock a star for the useless two-track add-on disc with Eddie Vedder. We really didn't need another version of Magic Bus, or the sloppy duet on Heart To Hang On To. An anticlimax.",1

2073,"A complete let down!: I had to read this book last year for my AP English class.After hearing all the hype about how it was a great American classic I was excited to read it. Ufoetunately, I was waiting for the plotline that never came. This book goes absolutely no where. It drags on and onwhile Holden complains about virtually everything and then th story just ends. Nothing extremely interesting or, as far as I'm concerned important, happened in this book at all. Just the abnoxiously cynical thoughts of a brooding teenager who's P.O.ed at the world for no good reason. Just another teenager and that's all. This book was a complete let down in my opinon and I wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. I really don't understand why people think it's amazing, it's terrible.",0

The set I received was very thin and VERY wrinkled when washed. They are also too big for my mattress even though I have a pillowtop mattress. The exceptions to the large size are the pillowcases. They are EXTREMELY small and do not cover my standard size pillows. Overall I would not buy them again and it makes me shy away from online bedding purchases because if you can't go by thread count or brand name how can you decipher quality.,0

2090,Not perfect: It seems the mat selection for the Wii DDR is very limited. I purchased this mat so that a second player could play. Overall the mat works OK but I prefer the mat that came with the game to this one. My biggest complaint is that you can really feel the joints in the foam under the dance pad. It comes in sections so that it fits in the box and then you put it together. I need to try and put something between the mat and the foam to try and solve the problem.It is nice a cushioning under my feet. This really only matters if you play for very long periods of time. It also doesn't move around or bunch up. (We only have a slight problem with the other mat moving around but it's not a big deal.)Overall not worth the money for a second mat but not a bad product.,1

2093,"Aerosmith in search for vocalist: The band play superbly but what marrs this album is Stephen Tylers unstoppable hard man of rock, tuneless and for the most part inappropriate vocals. He sounds like he's sitting on spike all the way through the session. You can count on one hand the number of times that Perry gets to take a solo without Tyler screaming his nuts off over the top of it and reducing it all to a mind numbing cacophony. The overall effect is to over clutter the mix, a blues singer he ain't and the word restraint ain't in his dictionary.Shame really because after about three listens, I can honestly say that there a about three tracks that I can bear to listen to repeatedly, mainly because someone had the sense to glue Tylers immense mouth shut for a while.",0

The first song comes right at you, rocking, heavy, an excellent song. Lyrically its moronic, but then again, it fits with the mood of the other songs. The, the album goes down hill. From that first great track (2 if you count the intro) the next however many songs just plain suck. It doesnt break any new ground soundwise, only bores you. Ok, it has horns, its ska. Ska was great in 6th grade. After that, all you fans of ska, you have a duty to realize how utterly boring and stupid ska-punk is. Groups that don't evolve die. Genres that don't evolve die (Punk anyone?) So yes, no matter how fast they play the music, this is ordinary, and boring ska fit for no one outside of die hard ska fans. And they suck anyways.",0

I guess I'm (like most) are not into random noises being construed as music.I can create the same effects/noise on this CD & I'm not even a piano player!",0
2107,"Fabulous music: Bought this new waaaaay back and thought it was great. Lost it for 30 years and found it again on Amazon. Still a good listen. Al Kooper gets a little off on the keyboards now and then, but Shuggie Otis is very good. And, don't forget that he was just about sixteen years old at the time! It's worth the money.",1

2109,"Good quality crib at a great price.: We bought this crib based on the reviews and low cost and it's 4-in-1 feature to use it over a long period of time. It arrived in a large box and was assembled in a short amount of time. I was not too impressed with the clear coat finish on the natural colored wood since it could be easily dented or scratched just with my fingernail. But my wife loves the look and my 1-year old son even enjoys being able to stand and hold onto the railing. We purchased seperately a cloth rail cover to keep his teeth from making marks on the front rail. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and the quality of the product.",1

2111,"E01S03 It Shouldnt Happen To A Dog (Grace Lee Whitney episode): For some reason,I didnt find this episode very entertaing. Im not sure why.

2112,"Lost in the text: I ordered this book for my Kindle based on reviews. I am sorry I did. Without pre-existing knowledge of the country and it's political problems, I was lost. The first chapter tells about a daughter going back to visit her ailing father. That chapter was coherent and I could follow. The next chapter was a disaster because that's where I needed to have some pre-existing knowledge. I had to put the book aside. I don't know if I'll ever go back to it and probably have just wasted my money.",0
2113,"It's a Pooh book they can learn to read themselves.: POOH'S EASTER EGG HUNT gives the kids a simple story that's easy to follow, with all of their Pooh friends along for the ride. The pictures have lovely bright colors. And the words are really big for young readers. The Step into Reading (this is a step 1 book) series is such a great idea for kids. There's an introduction here explaining the Step into Reading books program. Step 1 is for preschool to grade 1 (approx.). Your child will love having his/her own books, and these make an affordable collection to encourage young readers.",1
2114,Marley does it again: Kaya was Bob Marley & the Wailers best melodic album they did. For those that wanted to hear the sweeter and soulful side of reggae Kaya is the one. Although the lyrics werent as deep or political as Bob's other albums Kaya brings an approach that allot of 70's music brought but with a reggae twist. This is definately an album worth having in your reggae collection.,1

2116,"A very engaging road movie: It is easy to see how Gael Garc칤a Bernal made the leap to Motorcycle Diaries after watching this movie. Y Tu Mama Tambien is a very engaging road movie about two teenagers who discover there is more to life than sex, as they lead a seemingly unsuspecting older cousin (Maribel Verd칰) on a search for the perfect beach. It is a thoroughly engaging adventure, leading you through some wonderfully remote countryside before finally coming to rest in an idyllic location. There is plenty of coarse banter and sex to propel this movie, but there is more to the sweet looking cousin than meets the eye, the boys eventually learn. The story unfold naturally even if it is a bit hard to swallow at times. The boys' friendship is tested, lost, and regained with Luisa trying to teach them what it means to be men.",1
2117,"couldn't even get through the preview sample: ok, I haven't listened to this - the sound of the narrator taking a loud gasp of air at the end of reading each sentence was making my toes curl.And how can you mis-spell the title of the book?Perhaps it's great, or the sound gets better later, hard to say.All I know is that I could barely get through the preview.",0
2118,Good info but long-winded and poorly written: In my opinion this book is poorly written and long-winded. The author could have explained everything in a book half the size. His explanations are not entertaining either.The author is obviously well versed in chaos theory but lacks the ability to write a good book. For a good read on a similar topic that is much better written try The Black Swan by Taleb or The (MIS)Behavior of Markets by Mandelbrot.,0

It starts with calibrating your camera and meter and then sets up Photoshop to do what you need it to do, if you shoot people.I have had the opportunity to have one on one instruction from the author and that whet my appetite for the rest of the book. No it does not cover every eventuality, but gives a very firm foundation with lots of options so you can pick how you like your pictures to look like.",1
2120,PLEASE - Some honest reviews of this DVD: I LOVE this band - but I just wanted to warn anyone else who was sucked in by these glowing reviews - the vision quality - AND the quality of the shooting itself - is EXTREMELY dissapointing - so bad I could not get passed the third song. I'm 43 and and bought a ton of DVD's - but this would be in my Top 10 of the most dissapointing. BE WARNED. Sorry to the band - still love ya.,0

2122,"Waterworld: My Husband and I viewed this movie when it first came out, and enjoyed it. Seeing it again proved to be just as exciting, seldom does this happen.

2123,"Black and Blue: For a guy who is a special op's expert this book falls far short of expectations. It also has several glaring inconsistencies. A woman leaves her lovers apartment with only cash and no purse and then goes to the bad guys office, copies a disk and then puts it into her, well, purse. Where did she get the disk to copy on or the purse to put it in? Well we just don't know.This book is full of stuff like that. Save your money and buy Flashman instead.",0

2125,"And the loser is?: For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses.",0
2126,Do ANYTHING but watch this sleeper.: What a bad script. What bad acting from many of the non-stars. What a bad editing job. I see why this was never released in theaters; patrons would want their money back. Go watch TV. It HAS to be better.,0
2127,Dissappointed: Well I would have to say if it's possible to over sing your own song than Freddie Jackson has absolutely accomplished this without a doubt. He over sang every single song. And by over sang I mean he adlibs way too much too many runs and just too much of everything. To me it was nothing like any of his original work. I do not recommend.,0

In 1988 I had also an opportunity to watch video debate between mr shorrosh and mr A.Deedat. I found it is the same author who failed to give facts about Jesus son of God and about trinity in chrictianity.if the Author cant even defend his own bible how can he be able to challenge Quran. Mr shorrosh should have done a research on the bible authenticity,a bible was written by student of Jesus but not supervised nor approved by Jesus, Jesus and Mary are acceptable in Islam, but this fact is not known to christians.The book is bias rather than a collection of facts.",0
2130,"Self indulgent - terrible: If she could, she would kiss herself. This story is written poorly and simply. I have never read something so self righteous and self important. ""Everyone loves her, admires her and thinks she is the greatest"" - give me a break. If they are making a movie out of this book - it's only because sex sells. If she had looked deeper into herself and not into the mirror so much maybe we could get some insight or at least a story from this woman. It's a waste of good paper",0
2131,"Another gift for my tea loving son: My oldest son adores hot tea and he really wanted to venture into loose teas. So I grabbed this tea ball for him. It does a great job of keeping the loose tea out of the end drink. He has been using it for several days now and really seems to enjoy the option of making loose tea.Since it has the chain, we are able to hang the tea ball off the faucet to let it dry as well. The only downside is having the tea ball hanging around with tea still in it-- if it is wet it leaves stains on the cupboard. Definitely not the tea ball's issue-- I am just not sure what to do with it during this down time!",1

2134,"UN - Important!!: This is truly my greatest disappointment this year. Having seen the 6th Sense I was mistaken to believe that this film would have anything to do with the first. I was wrong!! This film lacks rhythm and meaning, although the story isn't awful the director manages to completely destroy any potential it has. It is so slow and annoying that it is almost painful. Bruce Willis is good but the dialog is hilarious, Samuel Jackson is trying to give emotional weight to a rather bizarre character and the result is just not quite what he indented. I only hope future films from Salaman will follow the guidelines from his previous attempt...",0
2135,"Read it, you will not forget it.: This novel was an amazing feature to the literature about Star Wars. I know as someone who has a fond love for Star Wars that this book proves to be a richly exciting, informational, and a lot of fun. I think all star wars fans will enjoy the number of stories that seem so distant at first. But as you proceed into the maze of ongoings in the palace you find they are all connected. How? Every tale interacts with another. Is that good? Yes, of course. You can see how interesting it exactly is. The thing is no matter whether you like Zahn better than Anderson, or maybe Barbara H. does it for you, they all have a tale to tell in this book.",1

2144,One of the most important books I have read: Ever wonder why the people in Africa are black? Or why most Chinese people look the way they do? Why European and Asian societies were ahead of the native societies with which they clashed? This book provides a scientific analysis of how these things developed. Essential reading for anyone who has ever wondered about the differences -- and similarities -- of people around the world.,1
2145,"Naughty Stewardesses Review: This is what an adult flick is supposed to be: nice women (no tattooed, body-pierced skags); competent acting; enough silliness that you don't take it seriously, but enough plot that you want to follow the story. The relationships seem more real than later flicks where moves and lines are wooden and strained. Most of the movie was shot at various pleasant locations instead of the producer's basement 'studio' like some. This isn't oscar material but doesn't pretend to be. It's an hour-and-a-half of light entertainment that holds your interest. I've paid more for less and so have you. A bonus is the opening credits/soundtrack by ""SPARROW"". I saw this movie when it first came out and that title song has stayed in my head for more than 30 years. So has Connie Hoffman, the petite blonde lead actress. Hubba hubba.",1

The accessories are sturdy and well put together. They don't seem like they will break easily.I also got her the extra accessory kit that had the dryer, curling iron and fake makeup in it. She loves the dryer. It makes a quiet noise but no air.She loves to brush her hair and teeth in front of her vanity.",1

2156,"Five minutes of fun for $100: We spent a lot of time searching for an rc airplane that wouldn't fall apart the minute we took it out of the box. We chose this one for my son's 13th birthday - he was extremely excited. My husband put it together and thought 'wow this looks pretty good.' They practiced a few times and it took several nosedives - no problem. They took it out to a bigger field - one of the wheels broke off on takeoff. The next time they launched it out of their hand. The final flight lasted a good 3 minutes but upon trying to land, the wing hit the ground first and broke off completely. It's a shame they don't make something that can maintain integrity with normal use. For the price, we thought this would be the one - not so. The merchant won't replace/refund so it's a shame my son's big 13th birthday present isn't something that he can use over and over for a log time.",0

I'm sure that on September 21st all of us fans will be more than delighted by the new album, simply can't wait!",1
2158,movie review: Well:I have never seen such a bad movie in my life. It is sin to even watch this movie. The concept of the movie is such a disgusting one that the good acting and the freshness of the actress is spoiled. It looks like that Amitabh Bachchan raped her career for the sake of looking young for himself. Even ramgopal verma's good direction was helpless to restrict the interference of Amitabh in the movie script. He played with the movie. He is playing wrong practice in the present scenario. He is just taking advantage of his position and money. It is appearing a devil's work at his age. I recommend nobody should watch this movie except those frustrated old people who still do not feel their responsibility towards the society.,0

2160,"HP 12c Calculator: HP has significantly changed the way they design or manufacture their calculators over the years. I purchased my first HP 12c more than 15 years ago, and now that it has been dropped more than a ""million"" times I decided to get a replacement. Compared to my original HP 12c, the new one I received has a ""slower"" processor and the numbers seem to ""creep"" up to the display (I've check the performance with multiple sets of batteries). Also, the keys do not seem to have a firm ""detent"" and one needs to check the numbers before entering or performing any calculations. These two issues alone compel me to question the integrity of HP products - currently and future purchases. The bottom line.... I feel I should have spent $10 for this calc rather then the $70 HP asked for. The HP 12c is not being built as a ""Sherman Tank"" any more, so I would certainly look around before settling on an accurate, robust calculator you can depend on.",0

2162,"Poor sound quality - for talk only: You get what you pay for.I like this style of headphones. They're comfortable; slightly in-ear for better sound and bass. But in this case, the design doesn't help the sound. The frequency response is advertised as 10-25,000 Hz with super bass. Don't believe it.If you're looking for headphones to monitor AM talk radio or audio books these will work, but the sound quality is too limited for any kind of music (unless you enjoy listening to your tunes over the telephone).",0

On the other hand if you are into mystery you would have no problem understanding the plot of this book. You would love this, but only if your into mystery.",0

Now that she is a mommy, I hope she doesn't mellow so much that she loses her edge. This is truly her best work to date. If you like Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, Lee Ann Womack, Loretta Lynn, Sheryl Crow, Dolly Parton or any other honest strong opinionated southern female artist then you should LOVE this record. This is not your typical Nashville country music album, infact it was recorded in a home in Los Angeles. Although she has traveled many a mile since the start of her career, when you play this album you can almost feel the warmth of the North Louisiana cotton fields of her youth. It is heartbreaking and refreshing at the same time. Honest, sometimes to a fault. BUY THIS RECORD!!!!!",1

There is not a particular track that stands out, for ALL of them do.I have listened to, enjoyed, and clung to releases by David Lanz and Suzanne Ciani, especially her Pianissimo series, but nothing has touched my heart like Mr. Trowbridge. You start with ""Daybreak Communion"" and it just gets better and more involved from there. A very great CD, and it is just too bad that it is not required listening for the general population. A wonderful piece of work that will stand the test of time. If you have the opportunity, but it today, as you will not be disappointed.",1

When Mitch mentioned Roy Milton as an influence, I had to check him out--so thank you Mitch, wherever you are !This generously-filled disc doesn't have even one weak track.

2181,"From an ex-Lonely Planet reader: What's the first thing you want to know about a country? Why do I want to visit. For answering this question Insight guides do an excellent job. Interesting descriptions complemented by pictures get you interested in Chile and what the country has to offer. Comparably Lonely planet guides are like a phone book. There is more information in them - often out of date - but little effort or detail is put in about the features of the country itself. My only problem with Insight is that its informational section is lacking. My suggestion is read insight, determine where and when you want to visit and then seek out up to date information on hotels, etc. from another source.",1
2182,"Very dangerous! Ours broke too.: DO NOT BUY THIS GLIDER!! My mother-in-law bought us this chair for Christmas, 2004.......it broke April 2005. It didn't even last 5 months! I really think the manufacturer should recall this chair. The back broke while my husband was rocking our 9 month old. Thankfully they weren't injured. The screws holding the back into the base would not screw back in and the wood split. Very dangerous chair. We were able to take it back to the store and get a store credit. Now we are struggling w/what glider to replace it with. But I will not buy another Jardine product again.",0
2183,"Not sure: This bokken has a good feel to it but it's much lighter than the other one that I boughtSingle 40"" Dragon Datio Bokken Kendo Practice Sword.The guard is nice, but it's not like the one pictured, it is a simple rubber band type that does not extend outwards on to the guard as shown. Also, the color on the one I received is much different. It is darker, like a wooden desk with varnish, but I still like it. Maybe it's just the seller, who knows: [...]Here are the dimensions, the hilt is 10"" (0.25"" more than the Dragon bokken), and the blade is 28"" (1"" less than the Dragon bokken), with an overall length of 38.25"" (Dragon bokken is 39"", an inch shorter than the advertised length).",1

2185,"Another show cancelled before it got a chance!: If you're familiar with The Tick, you know he started as a black and white comic for New England Comics in the 80's, then later got an animated series on Fox in the 90's. The live action version of The Tick was played by Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld), who was hilariously naive. The show follows 4 superheroes, The Tick (as dumb as he is big and strong), his (neurotic) sidekick Arthur, Batmanuel (who loves himself even more than he loves women), and Captain Liberty (Wonder Woman parody). If you're a comicbook fan, or just a fan of well written comedy then you'll love The Tick - you'll hooked and sad after you've watched all 9 episodes because there's no more!",1

The removable motherboard tray was even more helpful and easy to use than the other reviews had implied.The one and only complaint i have is that some of the hardware i was transfering in wasnt as high-end as the case makers assumed it would be.There was no way (without modding or purchasing extra hardware) for me to connect an IDE hardrive and a dvd-rom on one cable. I took out my drill and fixed the problem, but i wasnt planning on modding this case for quite a while.With top end hardware this would have been the best case i ever purchased, but because i was transfering a few components my life was made harder than i anticipated briefly.If you have a SATA hd then this is setup perfectly. I worked around it and am exceptionally happy with this case. This is the most happy i have ever been with a computer case.",1

2191,"Boring: Those of us old enough to remember Speed Racer know just how bad badly done anime can be. I love animation but anime is a different breed of animal and I just don't see the point. Black Blood Brothers is about 2 brothers who are Black Bloods, there are also Red Bloods, as well as, Kowloon Children, a 3rd type of vampire.The music and grapics are extremely well done, thus the 2 stars. What I did take away from the series was a sense of a caste system, even in the vampire world. You have the old school vamps who seem to be revered, they are the Black Bloods, you have the newer group of vamps who are the Red Bloods and you have the Kowloon Children who are feared, despised, and avoided. What I didn't care for was not really understanding what was happening, even at the end of the first disc. It is obvious that the story is going to unwind slowly over the course of several discs, but this makes it hard to follow. The storyline left much to be desired also.All-in-all, this was a waste of time.",0

For example, after reading the page entitled ""Body Count"", it would be refreshing to tell the kids (or even adults) that we are meant to be smiling rather than frowning as it takes just 14 muscles to smile but 43 to frown.This book makes learning interesting and light even for the whole family and opens a world of discovery that would probably keep you smiling for hours.",1

I really don't think the author had any clear ideas of where she was going with this story and any of it's characters. Everything is so shallow, repetitive and dull that after the first 100 pages I didn't even care what the outcome was.

Pars' book stands out from the numerous other books on dynamics.",1

2204,Powerful Message: I love this doll. Mattel sports a Rosie O'Donnel toy who is open about her sexuality and being single with adopted children. I think that having a toy in a more traditional light is also a good way to tell girls that no matter what people say or think they can do what they want. I like the fact that even though she is a married woman she is sold separate from her husband. It tells girls that you can be independant and be yourself even if you are married. I gave my girls one and will have one for myself. I think this is a very healthy outlook on the woman of today. Who better than to represent it than Barbie!,1

If there is a person on earth worse for manuals, that is going to be me.For once I found a book technical and friendly at the same time. As normally happens, there are always some black holes in books where the authors start to assume that you know something you never heard of, or it is not explained in the book you are reading. Well, this is not the case. Everything is explained. When I say ""everything"" I mean it. Absolutely everything is explained as if you never heard about Flash at all.My most sincere thank you to the authors of this book. I was scared about the power of Flash.

Nothing I did would allow me to access the Internet. The only reason I gave this program 2 stars instead of 1 is that it uninstalled easily and completely and my computer is now back to normal.",0
2213,"Good with the potential of being great: Gotta say this game was good but it could have been great.1.) Way too short! It's only five levels. If you felt frustration at Halo 2, get ready for deja vu!2.) The story line needs to be a little more clear. A cinematic at the begining of the single player mode would be great. Instead you have to wait at the start screen in order to get the back story, and that's the same one we've seen in game trailers.3.) A couple of glitches like the freezing of your character if you move while chainsawing. That's an easy remedy with a patch that can be put out over XBox Live.4.) The multiplayer could use a couple more modes (i.e. Capture the Flag, etc.) and only 8 online multiplayer maps. I don't feel like shelling out a bunch of cash to download new maps.All in all though the game was good but the rush to get it out in time for the holidays might have stunted this title.",1

What she found was a freaking good album by New Found Glory. My name is struckachord and I have a problem. I love these songs. They're so addictive and hardcore, but nothing that I've never dealt with before. Some of the songs make me want to scream, they're so real. I was really impressed by Jordan's voice and the rest of the band's instrumental achievements. Ballad for the Lost Romantics hit home, Dressed To Kill just kicked butt, Sucker made me laugh and disturb more than a few people on the plane home.

I always wondered what happened to him, and apparently he has a released a few more albums since then. ""Bed"" is part of a two album concept, the other album being named ""Breakfast"". I bought Bed not too long ago, and have been listening to it repeatedly. It's just as creative and originl as Modes of Transportation, except that some of the synth stuff is more contemporary. It still has some wacky elements to it, although it's not quite as wacky as Modes of Transportation. There's not a single bad track on it.",1

It has performed wonderfully, but I thought I should illustrate to other users the range that this monitor has, and the one quirk I've noticed with it:If the receiver is on, but the monitor in the baby's room is off, it can pick up other frequencies. We have heard one of our neighbors' baby crying over our monitor when our son wasn't home! I'm not sure if she has the same monitor and is using the same frequency, or what; but be warned that the range on this thing is amazing!

Serj has one of the most captivating voices i have heard in along time. I don't even like this genre of music at all but system has always hooked me with it's raw sound, and a voice that just pulls you in, i hate punk music and that's what i think of when i hear whiny darron, it just makes me mad that such a great band has to whine so much.

2224,"A Promising Start: This book is a ripping yarn, firmly in the tradition of Bernard Cornwell's ""Sharpe"" novels, set around the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD. I found the story gripped me, held my interest to the end and left me wanting more. The action was well-paced and the central characters were well-drawn. On the down side, some of the minor characters were a bit 2 dimensional (and, on the historical-accuracy front, I'm not sure the Belgae of southeast Britain rode ""shod"" horses). Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book and look forward to the further adventures of Cato, Macro and the rest!",1

I took only one capsule, and it made me very sick: within an hour I had stomach pain, and for the next 12 hours I was hugely bloated with nausea and very runny diarrhea. I'm not sure if it's the die off of bad bacteria or this particular strain, but I would approach with caution if you suffer from IBS or IBD. After I am well again, I may try this in a smaller dosage, but the one pill I took really threw me for a loop. I have never had any problems with any other probiotics before.",0
2226,Great product for the purpose. May be difficult to install: I ordered this particular model because it did not replace an outlet with the two USB ports like all the other similar products I saw. The only problem with that is that this is a large outlet and making all the wires fit into the box was a challenge. The only thing that would make this a 5 star product was to have a channel on the hot/black wire side to allow room for the wires to tuck in behind the box. Installation took about 15 minutes. That was mostly due to trying to get the wire on the terminals and still have enough room to push the outlet back into the box.,1

2229,Locked up first time: I gave this gift as a present for my father. I really wanted an mp3 player that had an FM tuner so he could utilize it at the gym. The first time he attempted to load the device with music it locked up and would not let him do anything further. I spent several hours troubleshooting and only found other people with similar problems and no help from the manufacturer that worked. At this time I am having trouble getting SanDisk to respond to my support requests so there is a chance I may not even be able to get it returned. Bad hardware or needing a software update happens in technology devices and I am willing to work with that. Bad customer support on top of it makes this product a disappointing waste of time and money.,0

I can't believe how much of good teaching today has to include manners and other things children should be learning at home, but if it does, here is the way to accomplish it. The book is good for parents as well. Mr. Clark's accounts of his teaching experiences are interesting, fun, and useful. I found that watching the DVD on his teaching experiences, ""The Ron Clark Story,"" helped me understand the book. It gave me a framework for the 55 rules.",1
2236,"This book has one ""trick"" and teaches it over and over and o: Behan's book is currently out of print. Maybe I should say ""mercifully."" I found a copy on eBay. I enjoyed the first explanation of the central thesis (use the prey instinct to train you dog) for the first chapter. Then the second chapter was the same, and the third and so on. I desperately wanted to find out something PRACTICAL. Gentle reader.., go ahead and jump to page 100 when you open this book. You won't miss a thing. And Behan will tell you what you missed.

2237,"Having never played the game: Having never played the game that this is based off of, I can honestly say that this is a unique and interesting tale - There are not many characters within these pages, but the ones that are here have depth and personality - I feel that the ending was a bit rushed, but it is left open for the sequel, so some time may be taken when you return to book number 2 - I think that the story was entertaining and fun and the excitement was good once things got moving passed explaining the history and the world - this is a solid four out of five stars",1

This movie is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen in my life.John Travolta and Samuel L are both hit men. It starts off with them attempting to do a job, and running into a lot of trouble. The chemistry between Jackson and Travolta is unbelievable.Then, we have Bruce Willis, an over the hill boxer being tempted to throw a fight. Inevitably, he ends up with a tough bookie out for his blood!Basically, the movie is a bunch of short stories, all of them related. A LOT of drug use, graphic violence, and sex. Really a guy kind of movie, but I can't see any woman not loving it either.I think when all is said and done, this will go down as one of the best movies ever made, if it's not already.",1

It is written well, it goes into the sales and trading model that is essential to understand for every new person getting into Wall St. Much of the technical aspects of MBS trading and securitization is redundant now as the advancement in computers have made complex cash flow modeling easier. So much of the arbitrage depicted in the book does not happen now. But it is essential to understand the trader mentality of those days. Now most of the traders are Quants and this culture does not exist. But Solomon brothers like LTCM was one of the defining firms on Wall st and no one could have told the story better than Michael Lewis.",1

I only used it maybe 20 times.The manufacture placed information tags - not removable - on the bottom so if the scale is hung up, instead of a nice, modern silver-finish, you see the tags and it is not attractive.The scale shuts off very quickly, so when you are packing and weighing multiple items, the scale has to be turned on every time - and it takes a few seconds to warm up.The material is light weight plastic.

2253,"One of Bujold's Best: I've always enjoyed Bujold's book, though I've usually been disappointed when they've won awards. Her early books were fun, but they really didn't seem like Hugo-quality books. The early Miles stories were enjoyable ""emperor-of-everything"" stories, fine classic SF, but little more. However, over the last few years, here books have gotten better. Miles has become a deeper, more interesting, more real character. Bujold has become a better writer. Her books are better, but still retain the energy and fun of her early novels.A Civil Campaign, the latest Miles novel, is one of the best Regencies I've seen in a while. The story is entertaining, the characters interesting. It's highly recommended.1999 has been a great year for SF, and A Civil Campaign ranks among the year's best.",1

2259,"Easy, yet hard.: The graphics for this game are awesome, espcially to the PS2 version (which makes everything look like a cartoon). The reason why I had titled this ""Easy, yet hard,"" was because, for me, the story mode was somewhat easy, but once you beat the story mode, you can get awesome techniques, that are hard to do (namely Goku's Spirit Bomb).

Half of the five-star reviews suggest that it was composed and rehearsed in nine hours, and that its ""beautiful"" lack of form is due to the improvisational nature of the project. The other half assert that it was carefully rehearsed for a year, and that every single bit of studio noise and ridiculousness was planned. I have my own theory: this is a giant, steaming pile of garbage. Here's a question for all of you b-fart fans: how would this album sound different if it was played by pre-school kids?

I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese.

Today, I started what seems like it will be a bad book that described ""plump, round buttocks,"" and naturally thought again of Updike and how much I had hated his description of women. I'm not quite motivated enough to diss him to go and check out another copy from the library to search for the phrases that I hated the most (white mounds of flesh..), but I was delighted to see that I was not alone in my disdain for this novel and this author (at least at this phase of his writing..), and I am pleased to add another single-star (regrettably not zero-star) review to his depressingly high pile of praise.",0

Actually, it was not so much a review as an ad, part of several mini-photos and descriptions that were not much longer. Sherman, a likeable enough fellow, was on the TV series SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS as a parallel to Michael Landon's ""Little Joe"" character on BONANZA. So.......now you know!

As the story progresses the disappearance turns into an apparent kidnapping with nasty and sick overtones and even a murder. The story, as usual for a Spenser title is packed to the brim with characters both good and bad full of life, love and emotion.The novel is also significant for long term Spenser fans, as we meet, along with Spenser himself, the delightful and lovely Susan Silverman, who not only does her best to assist Spenser with the case, but as the publishers quote on the back of the book, she might just help to save a detective, as well.We all should be so lucky!In summary, then, GOD SAVE THE CHILD is yet another classic by our favourite crime novelist. We have a happy ending, the bad guys get what's coming to them and Spenser's soul is a little bit closer to finding it's mate.",1

I had to return the glove because my son didn't like it, so I want to make sure you are aware of the ""Pink"" factor before you buy this glove.Otherwise, it's a nice glove, and the hot pink stripe actually looks pretty cool in contrast to the rest of the black leather glove.",1

The photographs are truly poetry in and of itself, blending beautifully with the words.",1
2310,"Fast Paced and Exciting: Reading A.B. Wallace's ""The Mark of the Werewolf"" is like stepping into a long novel that has hit full stride, or catching a movie after all the boring build-up has past. Not that this book doesn't have build up of its own. It opens with a bang and ends with one and there is plenty in between to sustain readers who love almost every genre. I kept thinking about the movie ""Wolf"" as I read this one. Not only for the werewolf elements, but for the big city atmosphere and the suspenseful moments of mystery and intrigue. The dialogue is very well written and the prose is quick to the punch yet articulate. The chapers are rather short, which lends ""The Mark of the Werewolf"" to be seen, at least in the eyes of this reviewer, like a movie on the page. A.B. Wallace has created her own world in her own voice within the realm of reality. Highly recommended!",1

I also like the fact it has a power indicating LED on the front, to determine that it goes into low-power mode when not being used.Properly balanced in my listening area it provides pleasing bass, not at all boomy or flat. At half volume level I achieve more than enough effect for my listening tastes.It's not high-end but it's far from low-end audio.",1

The battles are intense, and bloody, as they really were.Gibson first got the idea for this movie after reading the book ""Robert the Bruce"". I guess the time of the Bruce family and Wallace grabbed him so much that he made this movie. Yes, the movie is long, but it will pass in no time, you will wonder where the time went.

We all do it and nobody in particular does it. My conclusion is we won't see lots of knowledge manager positions open up under normal circumstances, unless somebody develops the field much further.

You dont wanna drag it along and have that scratch the surfaces of whatever your wipeing off but overall I say this cloth is worth the 5 dollars and cant beat the shipping rate I have gotten too at being free also.

This book is an introduction to one aspect of his system, co-written by Sid Campbell, another martial art master, and Gary Cagaanan, one of Sonny's long-time students. Anyone with an interest in Filipino martial arts should really have this in their library.",1
2323,"Studies of the Human Figure: The book promised much, but it gave little. It was a rehash of old photos and diagrams from the 1930s. Half the book was technical jargon without accompaning illustrations for clarity. What few illustrations it had were old and too small to be of much benefit. They were also positioned too far from the text to make a connection between word and picture. A greater effort was made for the sake of modesty of models than thoughtful book design. Although, I found that the photo captions were relevent and helpful.",0
2324,Don't unhook it: I like it but the part where the hose hooks onto the sink is made of plastic so everytime you take it off it strips the inside. The end result is water shooting out of the top part. I ended up going out and buying another one with a metal connector.,0

Yes, there are downloadable files/photos, but there is no step by step instruction to go with the photos throughout the chapters.If you are not looking for a tutorially written text, and just want dry information on how everything works in Elements, then you will be happy with this nicely formatted book.",0

Of all the tracks, the best are: ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" ""Most Anything You Want,"" ""Flowers and Beads,""""My Mirage,"" ""Termination,"" and ""Are You Happy?""

2335,"Sad movie, good acting: This is a depressing movie. Will did an incredible job acting and the story itself was somewhat original. However, this is far from a funny movie or a satire. This movie is just plain sad, so it should be in the drama category. So, if you like watching people at their rock bottom in life then you would enjoy this film, if you are like me and do not then skip it.",0
2336,"Not very helpful: The preface and first chapter are a bizarre rant against municipal governments, building departments, and utility providers. I haven't seen so much name-calling since my first marriage. The remaining chapters discuss building techniques, but not in enough detail to be useful for someone attempting to build a cabin. The only valuable information was the final chapter's formulas and tables for engineering larger structures.The author has a big chip on his shoulder.",0
2337,"Looking for a gift for the ""pampered hag"" in your life?: An excellent read without question. Although I am a Christian I found this book to be a great blessing and a relief. It's time there was a little good old fashion preaching on morals, ethics and maybe, if it dosn't jolt your complacency too much, Gods laws - for those other than Christians. A super gift idea for the credit card weilding, pampered individual who needs to have a slightly different topspin to their ball.",1
2338,"Loved it and so did the kids: What I seen through this movie was a Tale of Faith, Hope, Love, Courage, Strength, Truth, Justice, Compassion. The depth of this movie was amazing. I seen the application of many Biblical Principals throughout this entire movie. Light vs. Dark. Characters dealing with trials and wanting to make things right. I thought it was a wonderful movie for both kids and adults alike. I highly recommmend this movie to anyone. The journey is one that will stay in your heart forever.",1

2342,"Easy setup, serves most needs: The base unit was easy to set up and I was online with a minimum of hassle. The throughput wasn't what I expected it to be, but for most of my purposes that's not a problem. The USB setup procedure was fairly straightforward. I changed the default security information just because I didn't want to be using the same defaults as anyone else in the neighborhood, although I suspect the range is limited enough that it shouldn't be a major problem. The link works well except for things like network backups which can take all night.",1
2343,"Rachet failure is a common problem: I, too, really like the design and concept of the Kamenstein Paper Towel Holder. Unfortunately, after about a year the ratchet has stopped working - an all too common problem it seems. At least my Towel Holder has not jammed, but it now takes two hands to dispense the towels. There does not appear to be any way to disassemble my unit. It seems to be riveted together.Also, I find it very frustrating that I've been unable to find any manufacturer contact information. I wouldn't buy this item again since it would most likely fail in a year or less.",0

2345,"Clever, tightly plotted Euro-noir: A film noir in lgbt disguise, this movie puts together the appropriate elements--rueful narrator, love betrayed, clues to the conclusion--in fast-paced and clever manner. I found myself laughing out loud; the film deserves several viewings. Why the opening cigarette lighter? Why details as to nodding one's head for 'no'? Close watching will tell in this tight and taut, elegant Euro-mystery. While the in-jokes may be most available to those who understand Spanish, the naked stud can be enjoyed by all. If you like Hitchcock's classic, Strangers on a Train, this neo-noir will pick you up and leave you laughing, hitting the play button once again.",1
2346,"The product is good--the price is ridiculous: I feel kind of foolish that I've been buying this Nori from Amazon for a while now. To be fair, the Edozen Nori brand does taste great and is easy to work with when making sushi rolls. However, I thought $4.99 wasn't bad for a pack of 10 . . . until I discovered this exact same brand, same package for sale at my local Kroger grocery store for $1.99. Yep, I've been paying 2 1/2 times too much for something that was readily available at a grocery store chain. I would check out your local grocery store before buying this product from Amazon and you may get a much better deal.",0

Of course I have my computer there, along with the mouse, mouse pad, bills folder, etc. Upon turning it on, it sat there and blinked the activity indicator until I shut it off. I removed everything from my desk including the mat. Checked the snap connections on the battery pack (which the feet of the pack did not fit the cutouts on the plastic mat (small yes I know, but for $60 it should come close)). I placed the mat alone on the table with nothing on it. It blinked non stop saying activity. I set the mat on the floor and it was okay for about 2 minutes, when me walking around it set it off, indicating activity. I placed it on the table again (this is a plastic top table, no rivets, studs, metal of any kind) and it just blinked the activity light. It was a frustrating event considering the reviews others have given. Wished I knew how sensitive it was.",0
2355,"When's the movie due out?: After the English Patient, Saving Private Ryan and the Thin Red Line one can only wonder when the movie version of Birdsong will be out.This book appeals to the reader on a variety of levels -- one measure of an outstanding novel. Faulks' weave of love and war, his use of symbolism, time shift and narration are masterful.The symbolic ""underworld"" of the World War I tunnel provided a unique underpinning -- no pun intended -- for the book. This was a deep, well-written novel in more ways than one.",1
2356,"Insightful Historical Reading: In this tightly written volume, Australian author and academic Darren Tofts (internationally known for his essays with the fine science/cyberculture journal 21.C) surveys cyberculture's hidden legacy in literary theory, surrealism, and semiotics.Tofts takes great care to critically reference his material, and the lavish artwork vividly conveys the book's high production values.Necessary reading to track the pre-World War II aesthetics and artistic culture that would give rise to Eisenhower's military-industrial complex, showing how artistic movements mutated as 'life conditions' (mass psycho-social, memetic, and economic baselines) changed into radically new forms.'Memory Trade' is extremely useful for an academic or university-level audience, particularly for students undertaking media studies, literary criticism, cultural studies, and art history.",1

2364,"A mixed bag: The network (70-216) book itself rates four stars becuase it fairly thoroughly covers the material tested on the exam.The AD book (70-217) itself rates three stars because it misses some key areas.The workstation (70-210) and server (70-215) books miss broad expanses of test material, so although they may not be bad introductions to Windows 2000, they are grossly inadequate for exam preparation. Further, the two books are virtual carbon copies of each other.Overall, I was troubled by the lack of editing and several major factual errors.Please note that some of the other reviews are by authors and editors. At least they had the integrity to sign their names.",0
2365,The House on Mango Street: The House on Mango Street written by Sandra Cisneros is an excellent choice of literature. Esperenza is a young girl narrating the book. Esperenza's family moved around a lot. The book has many different stories. She discusses race and sex and relationships. On Mango Street she meets friends unlike her other homes where she lost her friends due to moving around a lot. I really enjoyed the book. I think the book shows how Esperenza matured. It taught me about morals and how family status affects you as a person.,1
2366,"Sometimes helpful for diabetics: Taurine taken daily can sometimes be helpful to type two diabetics. I know this because this product helped me. I had been on 1000 mg of Metformin daily for about six months, and even with daily exercise and weight loss from 156 to 126 pounds, my A1c was still 6.5. The closer to 6.0 the better, so 6.5 is still too high if you can do better. The only thing I did differently was start taking this product daily. Three months later my A1c had dropped to 5.5. For those of you who don't know, an A1c of 4.8 to 6.0 is considered to be in the normal range, and it is basically a measure of your long-term blood sugar levels over the past three months.One thing to note - taurine can build up in your system over time, and it can cause low blood sugars or, if you are very insulin resistant, make you quite hungry as this happens. Thus, you may have to experiment with the dose that is right for you.",1

Garmin then told me to send the unit back to them for replacement. About three weeks after sending the unit to them, I received a replacement, only this one had a loose antenna. The GPS worked fine at first, then it started having trouble finding satellites. Garmin then told me to send the GPS back to them for inspection and sent me a replacement about three weeks later.

He left KWS to jointhe Chris Aaron band, if you want to hear real Blues Rock, I suggest you check them out.We already have enough ""pop"" clones on the radio today. I don't mind a little stylistic change in order to move forward musically, but this, I don't think so.

2375,"Note to self- check reviews first!: Gawd, what an awful movie. There, that's out of the way. The other reviewers have done a fair job at explaining why this movie is bad (LOW budget effects, didn't follow the original story much at all, etc). But what really puzzles me is why they hired Andrew Bryniarski to play Dracula. Up until now, most of us horror-philes agreed that the chubbiest vampire on record was Lon Chaney Jr's ""Son of Dracula"" (which I liked in spite of Chaney's being a well fed vamp). Bryniarski has about 100 pounds on Chaney. Tall? Gaunt? Corpselike? No way- this Drac's been to the ""all you can eat"" buffet. Now I gave it two stars because I did like the period costumes. I mean, I had to find something redeeming in this film, eh? But the others are right- rent it if you must, but if you buy it, you'll be using it as a drink coaster after you watch it.",0
2376,"Excellent: Utada's album Exodus is another tribute to her talent! She create a unique and new sound, blending beautiful melody and tight beats.

I must also mention of Charles Durning who i think played his role nicely.I think 2 scenes (i won`t spoil which) which was surprisingly violent and bloody. I was suprised they could show that on tv in the US in 1981 with the very strict censors. It is not that i am complaining, but to the contrary i think it made it more realistic. I will continue to watch it in the coming years now that i know what kind of film it is and what to expect.Picture quality: 4.5/5I think this looked great. Nice colours, details and such. I didn`t expect it to look so good. I remember the close ups which had nice details and sharpness.Audio quality: 4/5I listened to both audio tracks and compared them. I did find the LPCM 5.1 remix to sound best to my ears. I heard nothing wrong with both.Film: 3.5/5Overall: 4/5",1

But there are two things I have not been able to complete because my soul could not take it: Faces of Death (those documentaries about things getting killed about dying and murder and ppl getting killed right there on the screen, monkey heads protruding to the top of a table, the top of the head lopped off while the monkey is still alive and then the ppl eating the brains. Good Lord.) and this book. It was rather pointlessly stringing me along for the first half,although I understood that the author was trying to set the scene of Father Knows Best atmosphere of the 50s. I didn't need all that, and was absolutely sick at what I started to read. The abuse was appalling. I've never read such a description and I, a former cop and avid hunter, was literally ill at what I read. IDK how anyone can survive the reading of this book. I just don't know.

2381,"Terrible!: The Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Cooker was terrible. It doesn't seem to allow for soft yolks, since the instructions state that the yolks should be broken before cooking. When I tried it without piercing the yolks, the eggs exploded all over the microwave. I threw it away after 3 attempts at making decent eggs.I had another type microwave bacon cooker that did a good job, but I had to place a paper towel over the bacon to keep it from splattering. The top on the Nordic Ware product is a good idea. However, being round instead of rectangular makes it hard to cook more than a few slices of bacon at a time. Since the cooker doesn't slope down, as my old cooker did, the grease doesn't run off, leaving the bacon standing in grease. I'm sorry that I wasted my money on these. I'm glad that they weren't very expensive.",0
2382,"Short book, long read: This is a painful novel, which is not to say there is little to enjoy. O'Nan's language is so precise, I found that I could only handle this book in spurts of 20 pages or so, it is that emotionally taxing. The second person narrative was wonderful at forcing me into the role of Jacob, particularly with regard to the tragedy that befalls his family. This novel is greatly rewarding for those readers willing to see it through. I don't understand how other people could have finished this in an hour or two (as some have indicated). They are lazy readers, more attuned to mass-market pop fiction than writing that challenges. Disregard their reviews. This is a sad and wonderful book.",1

2385,"Awesome, if You're an Ungrateful Teen: MCR is guilty of being the latest fad to garner mainstream success and acceptance from the teen population despite relative lack of talent. Disco, New Wave, Mallcore, and now this commercial brand of Emo are all fads that more or less die off when their fans grow up. The bad news is that this sort of music will continue to pollute the airwaves forever, but the good news is that this particular fad will die off in five years or so. This commercial tripe isn't even really emo, Fugazi was emo. I digress. As for the music, it's just what I'd expected. Poppy, angsty, and without much musical substance. Even the solos are pitiful, barely better than the leads regurgitated by Cobain on Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you're between the ages of 12 and 16 and think you're the most misunderstood individual on the planet, then buy this disc. If not, look elsewhere for music with some substance to it.",0

I had wanted to buy the CD version, but it was not available for a long time.

The tracks were originally released by Golden Records in the mid to late 60's. The LP would have come in a box with a comic and a couple other items. Listening to the sound clips provided, there's a reference to ""the sign on the wall reads"". This is refering back to the comic and is rather confusing without it.The production is very primative. No background music, rather harsh sound effects. Golden Records didn't put much effort into thier releases.One would have to be a hardcore collector of superhero related audio to enjoy the CD.",0

2399,Vavoom: BSO's hi-octane music is unique in that it matches the rebel sound of the Gretsch guitar of Brian Setzer with the big band sounds of the forties. Brian has a voice on par with the best who sang with big bands all the way up to Bobby Darin. The band itself is made up of crack studio musicians. I believe that the true test of a great band is to sound to same live as they do on a CD. These guys won't disappoint!. If you don't tap your toe or bob your head to this music you may want to have someone check your pulse.,1
2400,"EXCEPTIONALLY HORRIBLE: Horrible attempt...at entertainment, at enlightenment, at literature. Exceptional effort...at defaming people, at embarassing himself, at blurring the line between good and evil, truth and lies. I want my money back!",0

2402,"Double Talk: Many of the things stated in this movie have been proven to be outright lies. Moore talks about bringing out the truth and then he includes a bunch of flat out lies, to make the point he obviously can't make with the truth. He obviously is on a mission to destroy Bush and doesn't care much whether his effort is based on fact or fiction. This guy might be getting a moment of fame from democrats, but his insignificant below average talent will vanish back into obscurity soon enough. He needs a long bath and a shave, inside as well as out.",0
2403,Awesome!: This tool works just like I saw on You Tube. Both my dog's and cat's coats are now very smooth and silky. It is best to brush the pets while outside as the hair flies everywhere. I have recommended this to many of my friends.Great product!,1
2404,"Great buy!: I bought this for my fianc칠 for his birthday, the only downfall is that it is the only movie he ever wants to watch! Overall, it was a great gift, especially for those who love the Alien series!",1
2405,"Replacement parts not available: I was reasonably satisfied with my McCulloch Chipper/Shredder, except that I must use great care to keep from overloading the chipper. If it shuts down, I must take it apart to clear the jam. With experience, this isn't so bad. Also, screws holding the top plastic housing shake loose and disappear.I've owned it for 4 years, with intermittent use, rarely heavy use, and this is what I find:Once parts break, you can't get replacements.Now that the V-cutter has broken, it appears that my only option is to scrap this chipper. Unacceptable! I don't believe that I've received my money's worth of use.I think that in future, choosing a company that offers longer term parts availability would be a better choice - maybe Sears?",0
2406,"Hackneyed, Cliched, Trite...: I wasn't impressed with this book at all. The plot wasn't very interesting and the characters seemed flat and unsympathetic. Evans' research is impressive, but it was not enough to salvage this book.",0
2407,"Just plain Bad: Just plain bad. Here are my reasons:- The documentary has very few facts. Lots of first hand interviews, but those are more for emotional appeal than to prove a solid point.- High school level film making. Choppy editing. Music levels are often higher than the dialogue.- The parts (or acts) of the film (employee wages, effects on local econimics, etc,) are poorly defined. The transition from one topic to the next is rarely well executed.This film could be good:- if it was shorter- if there was an narrator to outline the points at the very beginning. Also, use the narrator at the beginning and end of topics, or at least, a title stating the new point to be made.- if more effort was placed into the editing. It is a rushed job at present.For a truely well-made documentary:""The Corporation"" by Jennifer Abbott & Mark Achbaror[...]",0
2408,"Very Disappointing!: I bought this Brenda Lee CD because I heard Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree in the movie Home Alone but was greatly disappointed, it is not the original classic recording that was used in the movie but a rerecording that does not have the same peppy charm of the original that she recorded when she was 16 years old.",0
2409,"Made for A Religious Audience: This movie is cloaked evangelism. I rented it because of Malcolm McDowell expecting not quite ""The Devil's Advocate"" but at least something on the level of ""The Devil and Daniel Webster."" I was disappointed. With the exception of McDowell, the acting was terrible. The dialogue is at best hokey, and filled with gems like ""the bible has been the most reliable source of history than any other ever produced"" all while Christian rock's greatest hits play on the soundtrack. I would have rather donated $3.99 to my local church and seen it put to a better use than this movie.",0
2410,"Fun, Fun, Fun!: Worm's Armageddon is one of the best, most fun games I've played even though it has simple graphics the fun factor is amazing.

2411,"this is perfect: after reading some of the reviews of certain customers, i am quite puzzled that some of them can hurl abuses like telling others that mariah has no talents, but why in the first place they have to buy that album..mind-boggling indeed. but anyway, this is definitely her greatest album, i mean in a way that her music direction change completely, from girl-next-door, to a more mature and woman-like approach...this is quite evident in tracks like ""The Roof"", "" My All"", ""Butterfly""... songs like ""Breakdown"" & ""Honey"" though not as beautiful as the former songs, but make-up for their catchy tune...""Whenever You Call"" is a classic, and ""Outside"" is the best...its very personal to Mariah and the lyrics is definitely very meaningful, to touch anyone's heart...this is so great that it can be regarded as a must-buy....",1

2416,Carla Hannaford has done an outstanding job!: Smart Moves is a wonderful journey into a fascinating subject! It was recommended reading following reading Sensory Secrets: How to Jump-Start Learning in Children. My first introduction into the topic with Sensory Secrets made me want to read more and Ms. Hannaford did an excellent job of making the complex neurology understandable. (I like the drawings too.) Thank you for helping me to make my job in education very effective in the goals that I set for the students!,1

2418,"Inferior sequel: Nelson DeMille is hit-or-miss from my perspective; his John Corey novels deliver, but he occasionally writes a mediocre book (Up Country and Spencerville). This sequel to ""The General's Daughter"" is okay, but it's mostly dialogue concerning Paul Brenner's tours of Vietnam. He is sent on a recon mission to find an eyewitness to a possible murder committed by a U.S. Army officer. He meets Susan Weber, an expat living in Vietnam, and she proves to be alternately likable and shrewish. The book is interesting if you want to know more about the Vietnam conflict or history, otherwise, skip it and read his John Corey novels. They have far more action and slightly more intrigue.",0

Highly recommended and even more so ""Soundtrack to an Imaginary Life"" is too beautiful.",1
2422,"No longevity to product!!: Yeah, its a great concept, but come on, for over a hundred bucks the product should last longer than a year!!! I bought one unit in 2009 (at a babies r us) and was in love with it for the first 8 months. Thought it was the best investment we made for baby! Then it started going downhill.....the plug to charge the monitor wouldn't stay in to charge and the static interference got worse. Also the volume doent work anymore, you have to turn it all the way up but then you get a buzzing sound. We have a second baby due next month so decided to buy another unit (the one I bought on amazon) the screen is so bright you cant even see the baby in the crib. I have mailed it back to the manufacturer. I am really dissapointed this product isnt made better for how much it costs.",0
2423,"A Mindless Read: This book isn't bad enough to throw at the wall, but it's not good enough to pass along to a friend. There is no mystery involved, no surprises, and the author demonstrates a very immature sense of justice. On the other hand, the characters were likeable and the story doesn't bog down anywhere.",0
2424,An excellent indictment of chiropractic as a health care sys: This is a carefully documented text that should open the eyes of the most devoted believers of this outdated theory that cannot effectively treat any disease but must resort to claims of releasing some innate powers by adjusting some never proven vertebral lesion. It is in keeping with my recent book titled Chiropractic the Greatest Hoax of the Century? which with the book At Your Own Riak compose three major efforts to expose chiropractic for what it is.They lay down the challenge to chiropractic to scientifically prove it's theory and claims.A great book.,1
2425,Consumption: For the price it is a great deal. The only problem for me was the thickness of the shake. The only manageable way to drink it is to mix each scoop in its own bottle and fill it up. Otherwise it is too thick. While this doesn't seem like a big deal you do have to drink about 2 of these shakes and unless you are accustomed to eating alot then this might be difficult and might make you lose your appetite for an actual meal. Might not be so bad if you split it up into 2 shakes with 1 scoop each. So I would recommend it but I would definitely keep the amount you have to consume as a consideration.,1
2426,"Plenty of ""Bells and Whistles"": Rightey, I like this mobo a lot!!! Plenty of cool features and 'toys! not totally on the ""cutting edge"", but, is VERY reliable and stable. Booted at first 'post"", and has been running perfectly since. Highly recommend it.",1
2427,"Awesome game, yet challenging: I Got Gameday 2001 for christmas and have played it quite alot. It is extremely fun when you play a human opponent, but I tend to get [angry]when I play the computer because I can't beat it. It is a very good challenge and I think its better than alot of the new football games. I thought that the selection of moves couldn't be better. Overall, I thought this game was pretty good",1
2428,"It's smooth and powerful with great ballad interpretations: I have the LP and will have to get the CD as well since there are 4 more songs on it. Don't shy away from these ballad albums, they are great and really show alot of depth and incredible mastery of the B3. I still have a ways to go to complement my 40 or so Jimmy LP's with the convenience of CD's.",1
2429,very good Quality for the Price: I replaced my old rv vent with this one. This vent seems to be 4 or 5 times thicker than a standerd vent for only $5 or $6 dollars more. It's sure to last much longer than the standerd vent Lid.,1
2430,Works well sometimes: I have had my Phantom for 2.5 years and have had it in for service 6 times to have the insides redone because it stopped working correctly. When it works correctly it does a good job but most of the time its broke. I have had 6 new baffle sets installed over the 2.5 years and now the thing is falling apart. I have been lucky so far that is has all been warranty work but I only have about 3 months left of the warranty. I have also had to replace the bag one time and it's about ready for another. The shell is not of high quality and is already starting it chip. I have a liner pool which was damaged by the phantom and I had to have 3 leaks fixed after one of the wheels fell off. I will replace it with a Polaris when it breaks again this summer after the warrant expires.,0

2432,"Takes the Cake: Tim Burton has really struck gold with his latest fim, ""Big Fish"". In recent years, Tim Burton has had his share of bad movies (""Planet of the Apes""), but over the span of his career, has released some of my favorite movies (""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). Overall, I'm thinking that this is at least in the top three. You see, this is the same imagination that made ""Edward Sissorhands"", but Tim has done something he's never done before. He made a film dramatic and epic, but still in the vain of his earlier works. Everything about ""Big Fish"" is breathtaking.",1
2433,"Too smart for its own good.: Reading this book, I could not help but see it more as a vessel for the author to show off his extensive historical and Christian knowledge than a tale about Saint Nick. There were far too many unnecessary details that drew attention away from the story.Something else that constantly pulled me out were the questions posed by Santa to the reader, it was as if the author wanted me to stop thinking about the story and instead realize how improbable it was that it was actually by Santa. I think with the direct questions, ""That last chapter was rather sad, wasn't it?"", he was attempting to remember a quainter time...it does not work for him.If you want an innovative and beautiful Christmas read, try The Legend of Holly Claus by Brittney Ryan",0
2434,"Excellence: After hearing Josh Groban's first cd, I had no hesitation to purchase this new release. Having only listened to the songs once, I am certain I will become an even more devoted fan to this young man's talent and superb voice.

2435,"One of the best albums of the year: To all those people giving this album 1 star because it's too ""soft"", OPEN YOUR EARS. David Draiman may have toned down his lyrics, but the guitar riffs and music are still as heavy as ever. Disturbed has not gone soft by any means, they have just showed the maturity and guts to improve their great style to near perfect. For all you who really like the harder Disturbed songs like ""The Game"" and ""Stupify"" from The Sickness, will love ""Intoxication"" and ""Rise."" And, for all those who can really appreciate a great singing voice will really like ""Breathe"" and ""Darkness."" ""Darkness,"" by the way, is one of those ballads that all metal bands write, but few do well. Disturbed does it right (as do Metallica, Pantera, and Sevendust). As for my favorite song, it has got to be ""Prayer."" It is the first single and sold me on the CD before I heard any other song. In conclusion, BUY THIS CD, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.",1
2436,"Misleading and totally biased.: All I read was the intro, some parts of the book here and there, and the epilogue... nothing else I needed to read to understand that this book was totally biased on Christianity against Buddhism. So I put it aside and just laughed to come here on Amazon. Unlike everyone who thinks this is a gem, I am not gullible enough to think likewise.If Buddha and Jesus met, there would be total silence. That's all. Both individuals know exactly who they are, and I'm sure they will never engage in an intellectual discussion to show who is better. Two beings of love cannot talk with the intellect, only heart to heart conversation is possible. Both beings know the truth in their own way. However, the author is all about philosophy and intellect. Clearly he needs to explore compassion and love a lot more than I thought.Anyhow, good book to laugh at; that's all how I take it.",0

If you don't plan on this getting carried around a lot, then it'd be ok.",0
2439,"Does what it is made to do: Good filter that fits nicely on my Canon 17-40 wide angle. Only downside is that, being a slim fit, doesn't allow for the Canon lens cap to fit on the lens any more--B+W does include a rubber lens cap that fits on to replace the canon one, but it doesn't fit quite as securely. Guess that's just the price to pay.",1
2440,"A slight exageration to offset all of the fives.: Yes Pavel has some good ideas for increasing one's demonstrable strength, and yes, one-armed pushups, and one-legged squats are perfect, no-equipment-needed ways to take one through the full range of difficulty in the major muscle groups, BUT why must he be so frugal with his information!. The principles are the same espoused in previous Pavel books and tapes, with two different movements. Every three of his books, (at least), could, and should, be condensed into one, with smaller print, less salesmanship, and a touch of intellectual generosity. I love way his proponents make the sparse number of movements seem like a virtue. It's not, not at $39.95, and not when I KNOW he'll be coming out with another product that reveals some 'secret'; that he's held back until all of the possible income has been derived from this one.",0

G'n'R is about rock, not ballads and power ballads and Axl Roses self indulgence. Wanna a G'n'R compilation? Make your own, save your dollars on this and buy Velvet Revolver.

2442,"Pomegranate Moisture Shampoo: I was introduced to the Back to Basics line at my hair salon years ago and found it to be a wonderful product. Now that my hair has lots of grey the products still due the trick.I like the Pomegranate for when my hair is cut short.

I can always rely on it to give the style it's ""kick"".I do switch off to the Back to Basics Raspberry Almond Shampoo (yes shampoo) to repair & soften my wanna-go-curly strands. And my husband loves this one for everyday use. (I never thought he'd be using something from a pink bottle) and scorns other men specific product because it dries the hair out too much.The conditioners are super packed to do the job. All the scents are de-lish, but a dab goes a long way. In fact I find that I don't require use of a conditioner any more; because the shampoo is so restorative by itself!

2443,"Microsoft Wireless Entertainment Desktop 7000 (Silver): Keyboard seems to be very sturdy and works almost as perfectly as advertised.Pros:Keyboard: Ergonomic, stylish, functional, responsive and portable.Mouse: Equally stylish, pin-point accuracy, includes very sleek charging base. Also, all 5 batteries required for the system were included! Nice move, Microsoft.Cons: 1. No dedicated number keys (but I knew that before I made the purchase, so I'm not ""really"" complaining:-). 2. The touch pad on the keyboard doesn't work very well in cursor mode. I have the keyboard connected via bluetooth to a PS3 console and a laptop which are both, in turn, connected to an LCD TV. Although inconvenient, I've had to turn to the mouse for navigation (the mouse bundled with the system is, by far, the best mouse I've ever owned, btw).Overall, 4 of 5 stars.

2445,"Almost great: This mixer works really good and has a strong power. If you are lookg for a nice mixer that works with power, this one is for you. It sits nicely of its end like an iron.I chose this over Kitchenaid's, another of my favorite brands, because it comes with accessories for just about the same price. I use the mini food processor over my big kitchenaid's if food to process is small enough because it is so handy and cleaning is very easy. It works really good. I have not used other accessories yet.One drawback is that if you do not insert whisks into the body correctly, they fell off while you are mixing. You will hear a click sound when inserted them correctly. But when you are cooking you are so busy you just want to stick them in and use it. It sometime gives you unnecessary frustration.I like Braun products because of their mature design and no nonsense function. But for me, the level of its product design and color do not come up to the Braun integrity. It looks like a toy.",1
2446,"YA GOTTA LOVE THIS SERIES!: Read the entire series (in order). Okay, Okay, I am addicted to Jamie and Claire. This was not my favorite in the series, but it still earns five stars. If you read the first four you know you can't stop now. Just go ahead and buy it and read it!",1
2447,"Intimidating, but inspiring!: I received this book as a gift, being newly into gardening in the NW, and at first thumbing through I was a little puzzled. It appears to be more of musings then a 'real' garden book and I wondered how useful it would be for actual gardening. But once I started to read, I found this book to be such a delight! So many of the passages made me smile, so many made me want to laugh and all were inspiring. I really enjoy being able to pick this up and read a little on 'spooky' plants or the use of variegated leaves. This and the Western Sunset garden book are helping me make a great new garden here!",1

They won't tell...: It seems pretty shady that the Bruder website has no email addresses for consumers to ask product safety questions. The Bruder website only specifies their toys are made 95% in Germany, in compliance with EN-71 and ATSM codes. Codes that in NO WAY exclude PVC, BPA or phthalates in toys. So I scanned parent safety websites, green toy blogs and COULD FIND NO ENDORSEMENT of Bruder either. Hmmmm. There was also no testing available of Bruder toys to show content. Hmmm....Might be wise to yank those Bruder toy boats out of the tub during bath time until somebody can confirm this item and others are safe.",0

If you really want to see what Jacquelin du Pre was like, then go buy an actual biographical video of her that they have here at amazon.com or you can go to sharmusic.com.

2450,"what a boring and self-absorbed, disappointing book!: I have never taken the time to do a review of any book online... but I absolutely think this book is crap and boring that I had to go to Amazon's website to write a review. I think the author is so self-absorbed that she has not really done any justice to researching and thinking what search for self and life's meaning really is. Granted that it's her book so she can talk about herself all she wants, and for some reason, a lot of people have bought her book that it has become a bestseller, there are so many more books that are more insightful on the same topic! I will be more wary next time when I see a New York Times Book Review that says a book is irresistible. Her book's a New York Times Notable Book... and I suddenly had this thought on whether author's can pay to get such accolade.",0

2453,"Not As Fun As It Looks: It's cute and colorful, but, for the money, it doesn't do alot. It should've been priced in the mid-twenties. It only makes the one sound. And, my biggest complaint of all, is storage. My two and a half year old son received this toy for Christmas, and, now that it's time to move it to the basement I am dismayed that it does not self store like the farm and other Fisher Price toys do. We have the one ""with Accessories"" that includes a little dragon nest and fencing, and there is no where to put any of these parts. So, I know the parts will be lost in no time. If your child has just one toy, great. If you have LOTS of toys, expect the farmer to live in the castle and the king to be off carousing on a carousel somewhere.",0

2455,"Inaccurate information: As a veterinarian I am involved in serveral bird rescue groups and this book disturbs me on several levels. One, the author presents the idea of cockatiel breeding as a way to support the hobby. There is currently a huge problem with bird mills as there used to be with puppy mills, and the last thing needed is novice breeder thinking they can make money by breeding cockatiels. Two, the author is poorly informed or inaccurate about several points of diet,taxonomy, and general health. I do not reccomend this book.",0

2460,"The Mighty Spinners...: 3 1/2 stars? O.K. - 4 stars. I am a huge Spinners fan and although I enjoyed this DVD, I felt I might have enjoyed it more. All the great songs are there, and the Bonus section has an extensive interview with the group. However, there was something slightly lackluster about the show - perhaps the subdued audience, or the aging performers themselves. Or the disparity that exists between our memories of the polished studio recordings of the songs and the (unavoidably) inferior live stage versions. Or maybe I'm just being too picky - I don't know. At any rate, Spinners fans (or fans of the genre) will still like this DVD, so by all means check it out. And for what it's worth, I saw the Spinners in a live show recently and was glad I did. It was pretty much the same act as on this DVD. They put 100% of themselves into their performance, and are truly a ""class"" act.

2462,"Great step by step instructions: I have been searching for a guide to the arts and craft interior know-how book, not just a lot of idea books which there are a plethora of on the book shelves. This book lays out the sizes of wood to use and the arrangements. I feel now that I can tackle the living room with confidence, something I didn't get with all those picture books of the classical Arts and Crafts interiors.",1
2463,More about Morris Walker than Steve Martin: I'm a big fan of Steve Martin but I can't believe he allowed his childhood friend to publish this book! My best guess is Martin felt sorry for Walker and he thought Walker could use the money. This book details several unamusing incidents (and a couple of truly funny ones) in laborious detail in young Steve's and Morris' life. It is certainly not a biography of Martin but more a very detailed but poorly written account of Walker and Martin's pre-adolescent friendship. I feel bad writing this because Walker is probably a very nice fellow but he comes off in his writing as a person with a lot of issues with the fact that his childhood friend got famous and wealthy and Walker didn't. I was amazed to see that the average review here was 4 stars but I noticed most of them were about the audio tape. Maybe the tape is better.,0
2464,"The book doesn't have a a shred of fact...: The book lacks a more through examination of the entire academic system. It seems to be a blatant attempt to discredit the academia. I have gone through the academic system as a college student-and found many inspiring ideas there-some of which conservatives like Shapiro would recoil at-like Amnesty International. I was very happy that the academic system is a way of inspiring open dialogue on a variety of issues like rich vs poor in an economic society or US domination in the world.Conservatives like Shapiro ought to understand that the typical college or university is a place to learn a variety of ideas-an example would be literature written by minority, gay/lesbian or women authors-which must be encouraged and taught for sake of diversity. Mr Shapiro cannot impose his will on many others-and he needs to understand that the place of academia is a place to learn a lot of ideas.",0
2465,"Underpowerd, low quality: I've had this one for about a year. The 1/3 hp induction motor is underpowered for the type of load a 4"" belt puts on it. The idler pulley has bronze bushings rather than ball bearings found on higher quality machines. The idler wheel seized on mine, and when I took it apart to check the bearings I found that the bushings were not replaceable, and not listed on the parts list. I was using just the disc wheel for a bit after removing the belt drive, and the capacitor that starts/runs the motor exploded. This is not unusual for cheap electrolytic capacitors, so replacing it should remedy that. But Grizzly tech support says that there is no capacitor! It is omitted from the parts diagram as well. Since this tool is made in China by who knows what company, Grizzly doesn't seem to have any idea of how to service or maintain it. You get what you pay for.",0

2467,"THE BEST!: this is the best Christmas album i've ever heard... and it's my favorite Third Day album now too. i haven't even taken it out of my cd player yet! :) i typically do not like the song O Holy Night (i know, i'm crazy) but this version is so beautiful and quickly became my favorite Christmas song ever. there isn't a song that i don't like on this cd! several of the songs are done live, and the audience participates in them some. some of the songs are sung in a traditional way, but still with the 'Third Day' signature sound. a few are changed up just a bit, but never so much that it takes away from the beauty of the song. it makes them even better! i highly recommend this cd!!!",1
2468,Boring: Couldn't believe that the story about such an important figure--the first and only woman prime minister of England focused on her delusional end! I doubt that much of it was even true. Was this in a way sexist? It reminded me how the rumor began that Thatcher and the Queen were very much at odds with each other. Both denied it. Thatcher said the story of two powerful women being at odds with each other was just too good not to make up. I think that pretty much applies to most of this movie. Streep of course was awesome. Not enough for me though to give this a pass.,0
2469,"This phone ringer is not at all loud: This phone ringer is not loud at all, we purchased this phone ringer for my fathers barn, so he could hear the phone ring over the farm equipment when we are working on it, the fact is the ringer is not loud and as a matter of fact the ringer on the regular telephone is much louder than this ringer!!!",0

2474,"Great little fan: Fan works pretty well. Its not too loud at all and the clip is nice and sturdy.I took a star off because of the way you turn it on. It is a dial on the back of the motor that you have to turn. While this works great in the upright position of the fan, if you position the fan so it faces directly up, the dial gets moved behind the bracket, making it less convenient to turn on and off. For me I have it positioned so its always in the position that the dial is inconvenient.Not that big of a deal but I found it enough to earn it 4 stars. I'm satisfied with my purchase.",1
2475,"Remarkable story of love and magic in South India: ""Khasak"" burst upon the Kerala, S. India literary scene in 1958 or so, with an effect similar to that of ""Midnight's Children"" on Indian-English writing. It showed the way to an introspective, impressionistic, modernistic style as compared to the sweetly romantic styles that had hitherto predominated. Set in Malabar, which has a reputation for being mysterious and magical, this book retains its freshness and its beautifully wrought characters remain true to life today--the book has weathered 40 years quite well. A new Collected Edition of Mr. Vijayan's works, including the new ""Infinity of Grace"" is due out in Feb. 98 in a Penguin India edition. He has also just written a sweeping family saga, ""Generations"", but it is yet to be translated. Rajeev Srinivasan",1

2482,"Still the benchmark: The first edition of Witness has become the standard text in intro to preaching classes, much as Broadus was at the beginning of the 20th century. Like countless others, I was guided into preaching with Witness. This second edition presents several improvements. The most notable of these are the inclusion of more concrete examples that illustrate the process of sermon preparation and the addition of some ""homiletical lore,"" addressing everything from filing illustrative material to Power Point. Simultaneously, all the brilliant insights and clear presentation that made the first edition such a success are present in this volume.As a student, colleague, and friend of Tom's for the last few years, I can say that this book truly does represent his great passions: preaching, and teaching others to preach. I cannot reccommend it highly enough.",1

2485,dollar store quality: The pretty red pouch does its best to dress up these made-in-China necklaces. The little bulbs are haphazardly glued on. Some are crooked and look ready to fall off.

2486,"An easy read, but not that great...: This book was added to my fluff reading list, and it wasn't that great. The main character is a neurotic twenty-something bent on having a boyfriend. And you guessed it... she works in journalism as an editor. She isn't entirely happy with her career, so much of her life revolves around finding a boyfriend. The book does have some humorous moments, but it just wasn't captivating. Interestingly enough, the plot was set in Boston instead of England like some of the other books in this genre for young professional single women.",0
2487,"Big disappointment for Tango fans: I purchased this CD with great expectations which were completely dashed. I have always wished that Placido Domingo would record a CD of Argentine tango, since he has the voice and sense of drama to do justice to the art of tango. So when I saw this CD, I thought, ""Wow!""However, this CD is a crime commited against tango. The arrangements are not traditional Argentine tango, but the most saccharine gringo tango. I wish that Domingo had recorded with a real tango orchestra like Color Tango or the orchestra from Forever Tango.Furthermore, this CD recycles music from the soundtrack to the Carlos Saura movie Tango. You might as well get that CD instead of this one for the few tracks worth listening to.",0
2488,"Tedious and Badly Overrated: I read this a few years ago as it was on a list of the best novels of the 20th century. Awful! While there are a few parts that are humorous, I thought the book as a whole was horribly tedious. If a student wrote a paper/essay like this he/she would get batted across the head. Verbosity reigns supreme in Heller's work, with tedium a close second. The attempts at humor are feeble. I suppose in the interest of being well-read it might behoove some to read it...certainly not for enjoyment. A shame really, because the basic premise is interesting and, yes, thought provoking. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I don't understand all the hype.",0
2489,~ The Best of the Star Trek movies~: The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .,1

2493,"It was good.: The book was good and clever. Very good writing. The humor was very tongue-in-cheek.The book description on Kindle said the publish date was July 31, 2012, so I thought this was a modern book inspired by the classic Jeeves and Wooster novels. The amount of profanity in Gaudy Night further reaffirmed this mistaken thought as one does not typically see that much profanity in an older book. But, at the very end of the novel, I discover this was actually written in 1936. LOL!The only negative aspect it had was it was a bit slow. Around page 350 (of a 500 page novel) I felt like I wanted to rush through it.There were a lot of characters to remember. I had the write them all down to keep track of them. I recommend anybody else do this. Otherwise you will get lost and have to flip back a lot.The slow pace didn't negatively affect the book too much though. It was still good.",1
2494,"Clear, Concise and REALLY FUN TO WATCH!: This is a fantastic version of TAMING OF THE SHREW. For anyone who is interested in really studying the text (and hearing it spoken correctly), this is the version for you! The actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying - (yipee!) They also have an uncanny way of ""speaking the speech"" which gets it across to the audience as clear as day. You dont need to understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance. The actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast - which I belive they are!",1

It worked great for the first few weeks, but now if seems like it's barely working, I can be in the middle of a workout, huffing & puffing away and the watch shows a '0' for my HR, or if not a really low number.

2497,"Implausible and Run of the Mill: This cookie-cutter thriller is, at the same time, both implausible and entirely predictable. Our hero seems to have endless amounts of money, the luck to meet only stunning women, and the ability to get them into bed at all times.

Howard Keel is excellent as are all in this Warner Singin' in the Rain calibre fim.This is the South pacific and the Annie Get Your Gun and other musicals Miss Day did not do, all rolled into this great film. It was true she could not dance for a while after a car accident, but in Calamity Jane she dances up a storm; she 's back in action and does it all rock.See this, and then look at Annie Get Your Gun and other musicals..this is way ahead.

I finally opened the pack of Foyle's War, which cost $47.99 and was dissapointed to see there were only 4 episodes!Two series of Foyle's War have run in Australia on the ABC, I would think 4 episodes would be around 1/3 of a series.Whilst I love Foyle's War, a very well made series, I frankly think the Set3 is very expensive, and is misleadingly advertised as I assumed I would at least get one series (12 episodes).",0
2504,"A great start to the series!: You've got to love this book! These Southern Sisters are so unique and fun that they are hard to dislike. It takes a brilliant mind to come up with complete opposite senior citizen sisters as main characters in a murder mystery. Anne George does it! And does it well!Mary Alice and Patricia Anne are great characters. They are spunky, fun, and find themselves in the midst of a murder.

2507,"Excellent, Fair, Assessment of the Beginnings of a Movement: Dr. Michael Williams has waded through the many writings of Chafer, Scofield, and Ryrie, to examine the origins of the Dispensationalist mindset that still impacts the majority of American churches today. Williams is excellent at analyzing and critiquing (but never harshly) this theology, and in laying out all the implications of their system. He is charitable - always trying to give these men the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their motives and intentions, which he believes were good. But he is clear at holding up their conclusions against the Biblical data, and showing how they fall short. It can be a little dry at times, but overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in why vast numbers of Christians in America have had so little impact on the culture over the last 100 years. Read this book, and you will understand, as R.C. Sproul would say, ""that ideas have consequences"".",1

Of a thousand pages, exactly FOUR are dedicated to creating a form within Dreamweaver, two to creating a site map. There are whole chapters on ASP, Coldfusion, JSP, PHP, SQL, server authentication - notice that none of those topics are Dreamweaver-specific and all of them could easily be found in books specific to those topics.I hate it when programmers try to write for end-users.

2512,"Unfortunately an Unbalanced View: Dr. Geisler is, unsuprisingly, a very well known apologists, however, and 'apology' is what may be needed for this ""unbalanced"" view of the doctrine of election. Geisler should just come out and say he's Arminian instead of hiding behind the mask of ""Moderate Calvininism."" He equivocates and misrepresents many of the most crucial issues regarding ""extreme calvinism"" (which is how he characterizes the view in this book). Geisler attempts to use certain Scripture to support his views, unfortuantely he seems to be grasping at almost any verse to try and get this ""support."" I have read many of his books and find them very rewarding so it is with sad respect that I have to admit that this was not quite up to par with his other works. However, this book should stir up more contraversy over a much debated issue.

Tishara Cousino is attractive to me, since I love pretty and sexy Italian ladies, and she has two scenes in this one. One in which she dances is rather sexy. Vanessa Gleason is always sexy to me, and she has one clever scene with a guy in a haunted house. There are other girls in this scene, but Vanessa is the only one who appeals much to me. As I said, Vanessa is always sexy, but she has better scenes in other videos. Some of the other girls look nice enough, especially Elke Jeinsen, but none approach Tishara and Vanessa in my book.",1

This album is filled with classics like ""The Atrocity Exhibition,"" ""Passover,"" ""A Means to and End,"" and ""Heart and Soul."" All the songs are almost like a grim intimation of Ian Curtis' suicide. Appropriately enough, the album fills your head with images of Ian hanging from the ceiling, while simultaneously inducing feelings of dark romanticism and even some glimmers of hope. Joy Division were a band ahead of their time and this album only helps to prove it.",1
2525,"worked once: This would be great if it had worked more than once! The mount itself is wonderful, but my connection was bad, when I'd switch back to my old one it worked perfectly, so I know it's the connection on the mount. I may have gotten a defective one",0

2527,"Barely entertaining...: ...as the story (however stupid) drags on (into nowhere). Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says ""The hunt for the gold begins here"" and ""The search for the mysterious ship"" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment. Sahara is a failure, lacks charm and story, and will soon be forgotten.",0
2528,"Christmas--The way it should be: I remember seeing Santa and the Three Bears on television a few years ago. I loved it!! It made me think of the old Christmas specials I used to watch as a child. Unfortunetly they took it off the air. I feel something is totally lacking in today's animated films and specials. This generation is too computerized and well...fake. This 1970 Christmas film takes you back and really does make you feel like you are in the Christmas sprit. It does that with the songs and plot of the story. That is why I am going to introduce my daughter to this film. I want her to feel the same feeling I had growing up watching wholesome/quality shows. This film really does show ""the wonders of Christmas time"".",1
2529,"Mavis --> There's Only One Diesel with Sidebars!: What can you say about an engine who manages to get cheerful little Toby mad at her!Mavis is a young, feisty diesel whose inexperience frequently gets her into trouble. That said, she *is* learning; and certainly after she shows her usefulness, she becomes one of the crew. (Even though she is a Diesel they don't hold that against her.)Like all of Thomas' friends Mavis is sturdy and a great pal. She is also very useful in the development of 'made up' Thomas tales.In appearance Mavis is black with the yellow markings around her square face. In addition, and for reasons unexplained, she has sidebars and a cow catcher which is certainly not standard quarry attire. It does mean, however, that she can substitute on Toby's line from time to time.Four stars. Mavis is a nice, second-string engine.",1

2533,"Huge let down!: Whoa, what happened to the normal fast-paced Grisham fluff? This was one of the most depressing novels I've read in years. I won't be reading any more Grisham, there are too many other authors out there who can entertain more consistently without leaving you in a ditch at the end. The book did have potential, which saves it from getting only one star.",0
2534,"Not Bad.: I bought this a couple of years ago and just started using it again recently. I use it often, usually for an hour at a time. My only complaint is that the seat is not very cushioned. By the time I've been on the bike for an hour, I can no longer stand the bum pain and I have to stop. I am glad to have this bike, though. There are days that I do not get to go out to exercise and the bike is a good alternative for me. Plus, I can just sit and watch a movie while I ride it, so it doesn't get boring.",1

SuperS goes straight into StarS but in America, sadly, this is the furthest Sailor Moon has gotten.I really like the how this was ended. It reminded me of how the movies end. I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but trust me, if you like the SuperS series, this is a must have. There are only three episodes on this DVD but its worth every penny.",1

However, many of the principles found in the book can also be applied to any other local auction sites such as Trademe.I wholeheartedly recommend the book to kiwis, but (to use a pun) the book does require some unencryption from the American language!",1
2538,"God and Business can co-exist.: My one regret was never meeting the author. He was my godfather. He taught my father in Sunday School and was a powerful Christian. From what I have learned about Mr. Mitchell is that he was a humble God fearing man. His book outlines his philosophy about business and how important it is to keep God in the boardroom. By giving examples of certain situation he explains the duty of the Christian steward as it applies in scripture.There are several examples regarding his business and also examples of other people and their faith. His company was doing things that some of the more ""enlightened"" company are doing today. To give you an idea of one of the products this man's company produced is the created the ICEE machines. Before there was factory installed air-conditioning another product was the MARK IV car air-conditioner.This is a must read for everyone not just business people.",1

I hadn't even heard one song from it, but I thought I'd take a chance.I'm glad I took the chance. This is a VERY good album. Norah's got a great voice and there's a nice mix of songs on here.Considering that I don't care for most of the music by musicians close to Norah's age, this album really surprised me. Norah shows a maturity and a talent that aren't very common these days.I'm glad I bought this. Do yourself a favor and give it a listen.",1
2541,Piece of crap!: First use and flooded my floor. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Went through the directions looking for something but didn't find anything outside what I had done the first time. DON'T BUY!,0

I have not gotten completely through the book- so maybe there is some saving grace in there- however I'm having a hard time picking it up. So far I recommend my previous read more.",0
2544,"Awesome: Not only is it great to have all of Jo Dee's hits on ONE CD, but it's SO great to hear some new stuff from her! It's been nearly 3 years since she last released a new album (other than her Christmas album), and being able to listen to her new songs was worth the wait! All of them are great, but my personal favorite is 'I Wish'....very emotional and raw. This album is a must have!",1

2546,"What happened??: After the first two books, this reader expected the characters and the plot to develop. Unfortunately, Servant of the Dragon reads like a shopping trip to the fantasy stacks at the local bookstore! Drake established some really promising characters and world building in his first two books in the series, then in this installment, the reader is forced into all sorts of confusing battles where the main characters are seperated are tossed about from world to world facing unrelated situations. I really enjoyed his first two books but Servant is almost unreadable.",0
2547,"Great movie, horrible reviews: We all know by now this movie is what it isIt has it's flaws, but everything is made up/edited now a daysFor what it's worth, it is entertaining and it is not ground breaking by any means, the basis and whole motivation to make this movie was two fatties who were trying to sue McDonald's beacuse their food made them fat, so obviously he proved itDefinitely worth watching at least once, I actually find it motivating and it makes me glad not to be a ""heavy user""As for a majority of reviews about it, I was actually surprised there are so many health experts and dieticians out thereSimply put, you can eat as many calories as you want and not get fatIt's a little thing called exericse-calories in, calories outCalories are not the enemy, calories = energyOn another note, I would recommend another doc. called Bigger, Faster, Stronger",1

2549,"trendy, cute, and fundamentally dishonest ..: Goldberg's straw man is Statist Liberalism, not to be mistaken for the Statist (alleged) Conservatism he advocates. Although he reacts to the ""nanny state"" with horror, he believes strongly in a sort of neo-Jacobin global revolution (in true Trotskyite fashion) that promises to shake up the lives of persons living far beyond America's borders. Is this not a sort of ""nanny state"" on steroids? As for his association with National Review, it is something of a sick joke: 20 years ago Robespierre was the *bad* guy. Today? He is the archetype for Michael Ledeen and numerous other National Review contributors. Goldberg's position on Woodrow Wilson is especially puzzling, as Neoconservative, Scoop Jackson Democrat, and Wilsonian Democrat are practically interchangeable (think Joe Lieberman or Charles Krauthammer / liberals for the most part, albeit liberals who never met a war they didn't like).",0
2550,"Biggest budget-fewest laughs: This one is a real stinker for several reasons. First, the gags are often dumb and Costello milks each one so they go on and on. Second, the story is a confused mess so you care about nothing. Third, The whole thing seems to go on forever and there's only one song! On the plus side, the silver ore routine, the bullfighting finale, and Bud tearing Lou's clothes off are all funny. But this dog out barks the few laughs.",0

2553,"boring, indulgent waste of viewer's time: This is the sort of movie that all the critics will love, and regular viewers will wonder, why did anyone feel compelled to write a screenplay and produce a movie so void of entertainment. I guess the actors may have done a great job in their roles, but who cares when the story is this lame and unattractive. I felt like I had been robbed of two hours when it was over....and some relief that I could quit watching.",0
2554,"yuck - cumbersome: the scanner was purchased mainly to digitize boxes worth of 35mm photos. The picture quality is lousy - the dust removal option in the HP software helps a little, but I have to spend a ton of time in Photoshop cleaning up each image. Secondly, it's horrible at differentiating between a photo and blank space. When I put multiple photos on the scanner bed, it rarely gets it right. Again, I have to spend a lot of time manually selecting the photos. When I was shopping for scanners - I skipped over the $100 range and went to the $200 range because my family photos are important to me. I know you can go way up from there too - but digitizing photos is a colossal job already ! - I resent that I've lost so much of my time due to the scanner's poor performance.",0

There is nothing in the description that says it's used. The book received is a used library book with stamps all over it. It was delivered badly wrapped as well.So, if you're looking for a new book, this seller doesn't provide. However, if you are looking for a book on London (or any other European city for that matter) that's written for children, you might want to buy anyway. They aren't easy to find.",0

The melding of fantasy and fact, past and present, is quite adept...with just a touch of spiritualism for those who like to contemplate further than what appears right before their eyes.It reminded me of The Talisman, yet the Arthurian theme here carries a noble energy to the plot that had me wanting to raise a sword with the Knights of the Round Table.relax for a few days at home with this one, when you just want to take a load off...",1

2561,If you use big tea leaves...: I bought this for my husband based on the ratings and we were very disappointed. The tea baller we bought him till this one came was much better. He uses a tea that has smaller leaves which this infuser can't hold. If you use a tea with big leaves then this is for you.,0
2562,"disappointed: Appears to be a well made product. However, it came with no directions, or templates.

2563,"Another dismayed buyer: Just so you know, I read the reviews that others wrote about this dresser. I decided to ignore them since I had recently bought another piece of funiture from Amazon with mixed reviews, and my gamble turned out great. However, I wish that someone would have thought to mention in any of the reviews, not to mention the product description, that the drawer bottoms were made out of reinforced cardboard (same as the back of the dresser), and the tracks of the drawers are made out of plastic. Plastic!!! I was looking for a real dresser, not a playhouse pretend-time dresser. If you plan to store empty egg cartons in yours, then this is totally for you. If not, please keep shopping.",0

2565,"Good book with good caracters, though missing some story: I've watched the movie before reading the book so I might have missed some of the surprise-effect of the book. I just wanted to drop a line mentioning that I really liked this book but I think that John Grisham could add a little more consistency to its story (it is incredible how things turn out with no clear explanation). That is why I gave it 4 stars.",1
2566,"A Joyous Christmas Album!: This is one of the best gospel Christmas albums of all time. It is on my ""must play"" list for the holiday season.As mentioned in other reviews, this version of silent night is one of the best I have heard. Sound nothng like the original tune but is still superb. Other standouts are: The night that Christ was born, Go tell it on the mountain and the very touching ""Love Song"".But the best song on the album is hands down - Now Behold The Lamb. This song will give you goosebumps. It speaks of Jesus's sacrifice when he became the lamb of God to die for our sins. The vocals of Dalon Collins will blow your mind. He is truly gifted.This is a must have for anyone's Christmas collection.",1

A little useless unless you have perfect pitch and know your scales and arpeggios inside-out. I wrote the publisher to comment/complain but their response was lame. But I'm sure they received this feedback before. Shame really, they could have asked the author to hand write the chords and re-published the book. Not a lot of work.",0

2571,"Seven Girlfriends for One Guy: Okay,the title doesn't have the ring of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""Tim Daly plays Jesse,the Chef Who Can't Commit.As his character has problems with commitment,so does the director with the tone of the movie.Is it drama?Is it romantic comedy?Is it supposed to be funny?To complicate matters,there are dream sequences,such as when his ex-girlfriend who died in a car crash comes alive at her funeral.There's a love scene within an inflating hot-air balloon(???)There are incriminating photographs that fall from a ceiling,and eventually land in pudding&among; mourners.There's an endless drive with the insomniac heroine.There's even a scene when Jesse meets up with a lesbian ex-girlfriend.The hero's ""self-discovery"" isn't exactly convincing since the director doesn't seem to know what genre to use.This belongs in a cheesy film festival,not ranked with ""High Fidelity.""It doesn't take itself seriously;neither should you.",0
2572,"Best meals I've ever had: This book certainly has more prose than necessary, but the recipes are the important part - and these recipes are great. If you are looking for simple, rustic, italian recipes, there are plenty of other books to chose from. This author, however, provides the best collection of recipes that goes beyond the basics, providing the reader with meals you won't see anywhere. The recipe for chestnut flour-ricotta gnocchi are a good example.",1
2573,"If only there were a '0 stars' option: OK, first of all I have been watching wrestling for 24+ years, seen every PPV the WWF/E has put out and this is by far the worst. This is nothing like the greatness the WWE is putting out nowadays. For example, night after night John Cena and Randy Orton are putting on wrestling displays and getting standing ovations... Where was I when the WWE turned to crap in 2002? Psycho Drivers? 630 Splashes? The fans don't want fast paced action. They want to see more classic finishers such as the RKO and the F-U. When I'm sitting in my Mom's basement watching this crap, I get so angry that I just pop in a Kevin Nash match to calm me down. The Jacknife Powerbomb... Ah, now THAT's a finisher. Anywho, to sum it up, all of the matches sucked. Spend your money on New Year's Revolution '05. You'll be happier.",0

I got it to start working but then it said that there was no block in the coal car, which was not true. I got it to work for about a minute and it then recognized the wrong letter in the coal car. I do NOT recommend this toy for any child. I never had a problem with a leap frog toy ( my son and nieces have a lot of them)and I was terrible disappointed with this toy.",0
2578,"Amazing Album: I first heard this CD in my friend's car. I hadn't ever really listened to the Dixie Chicks before (other than their version of Landslide, which I also loved), but this album got me hooked. I proceded to purchase their other albums, ""Home"" and ""Wide Open Spaces."" I've even started listening to some other country music after hearing what a cool genre it can be. These performers are incredibly talented, and I'm glad they stuck it out through all that they've been through in the past couple of years. I didn't ""discover"" the Dixie Chicks until after their concert came through Washington, D.C., but I'll go next time they come back.",1
2579,"Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets ""aspects"" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.",1
2580,"Great reader in ethics...could use a more recent update..: This is a very good intro to ethics and meta-ethics. Singer is a good writer and his piece at the beginning is almost worth the price of the book alone. It's more of an overview of the classic texts than a state of the art primer on modern research (e.g. the newest primate studies, psychological / neuroscience based studies, etc.).... then again it was written in 1994.

It reminds us of the personal things that we find beautiful. And it tells us to push beyond the surface of things so we might find that which we did not see before. Its a film filled with powerful performances and heartbreaking tradgety. Some people may not understand this type of movie. But those people are blind anyway, and probably are obsessed with action movies. And lets face it those are the worst people. AND WHATS WITH THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS DVD. DONT YOU BUY A DVD FOR THE MOVIE, NOT THE EXTRAS. Thanks for that. AMERICAN BEAUTY is master storytelling and well possibly the most brilliant film of all time.",1

It minces all of the garlic clove and the interlocking pieces of the garlic press lift up so that its clean up is so easy!! No more bits of garlic stuck in crevices that you can't clean. It is worth every penny. You will be glad that you made the investment. Over all I love Kuhn Rikon's products but this one really is incredible.,1

2590,"A theological beach novel: Like all the books in Susan Howatch's Church of England series, ""Scandalous Risks"" has a page-turning plot and a good dose of romance and intrigue, while also being an exploration of 20th-century Anglican theology and spirituality. In this novel, the sexual tension is between a young woman and a married Anglican priest, and theologically, it's about a certain type of liberal theology (specifically, the 1960s book ""Honest to God"" by Bishop John Robinson) and its potential for misuse.The six books in the series, plus ""The Wonder Worker,"" which might as well be part of the series, move through the 20th century and have overlapping characters, but there's no need to read them in order. My favorites are this one, ""Glamorous Powers,"" and ""Absolute Truths.""",1

2599,"NUVI 360: Fantastic GPS device. Easy set up for Blue Tooth wireless to our cell phone as well. Easy to use. For example where ever you are you can hit ""Go Home"" and it automatically finds where you are and calculates your return all in a few seconds. The 360 is like the newer 660 but a slightly smaller screen, making it good value.",1
2600,"A good buy...: The format is very helpful--I found it much, much easier and more effective than either trying to learn words from a list, or making my own flashcards. One downside, though, is that there were some words that seemed too easy to be useful to most people taking the exam. They may have been able to trim out fifty or so words, or at least replaced them with more challenging ones. Overall, however, this is something I would recommend to anyone else I knew studying for the GRE.",1
2601,"B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!: I can usually read almost anything, but I can't even finish this one. I bought this on impulse thinking it was an Alex Cross mystery (which are definitely going downhill also)and was very disappointed to find that it was a sequel to the equally stupid When The Wind Blows. This thing is just boring - don't waste your money or your time! The only Patterson left on my reading list after this will be Richard North, not James...",0
2602,"Roaster Oven: Iam glad, I purchased a roaster oven to cook my turkey's in because it's much easier to clean than an oven! You'll save yourself lots of time! But anyone with small children should know the outside gets very hot and lots of steam will come out when you open the lid, so be careful while checking on your turkey!",1
2603,"Not enjoyable at all.: I agree with other reviewers that said some will love this book and others will hate it. I fall into the latter category. The main character is unlikable to say the least. I thought the style of writing was hard to follow and ineffective. For me, this story was a big miss.",0
2604,"Quality Cleaning Kit: This cleaning rod is made of thick, high quality brass. It feels sturdy in the hand. The plastic end also feels thick and sturdy. Seems like a quality product that will last a while.",1
2605,"Excellent Book!: My daughter is 9 months old and she absolutely loves this book! The pictures are big, colorful and wonderful--and it really gives me the opportunity to make the various sounds of all the animals, and she just gets such a kick out of it! She picks it out and we read it together everyday and now she's starting to understand the animal sounds outside of the ""book context."" I'm amazed by her interest in it! I highly recommend ""Animal Sounds.""",1
2606,"Fast. but really noisy: I've been a Mac fan since the PB 180, but had gone PC for a while. I came back to the Mac with this DP G4 and love it. It's fast and has all of the goodies. We made a DVD of my son's first year with iMovie and made a DVD our families love. You can't do that on a PC without a lof of expensive software and hardware. My only issue is the noise.",1
2607,"Please let this kid go back to his mamma.: Okay, I borrowed this album from my friend yesterday. I didn't expect much, for this kid was 16. And guess what, it was even below the expectations of a 16-year-old. This kid just don't know anything about hip-hop. His wordsplay and his rhymes; I could flow better than that when I was 13. His voice; nauseating and high-pitches as if he was a girl. The beats; worse than the ones I can make in like 4 minutes. If you really want to hear a good album, buys stuffs from Biggie, Pac, DMX, Eminem, heck, even Chingy is better than this.",0
2608,"Anime without the annoying parts: Watched some anime on netflix out of curiosity, came across this and it is different than every other thing i watched. The animation is darker and more detailed, quite artistic, not any of the cartoony over the top animation that seems to be standard with anime. The story is engrossing and heavy, couldn't wait to watch the next episode. Very violent, not for kids, some adult language. With japanese movies I like listening in Japanese and reading subtitles, but this was better with english overdubs, they did a really good job, the english has more emotion than the original Japanese. I'm not an anime fan, but I love this, so much I bought the series to keep in my video collection, its the only cartoon thing I have, this should be considered in a different category than anime. If your looking for Dragonball z or fullmetal, this isn't it. They took a more adult approach to the animation. Its so good it ruined all other anime for me.",1
2609,Just OK: Not as good as I had expected being that both Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx were the primary actors in this movie. Jamie Foxx wasn't very believable in his role. Robert Downey Jr. did a fine job in his role but the movie just wasn't all that great in my opinion. This is the type of movie you would only watch once and not want to see again. Once is enough for this one.,0
2610,best peeler ever: I've used straight Oxo peeler for years and thought it was the best until I purchased this. It feels so very comfortable and it feels like you use no effort to peel potatoes and carrots. It's extremely sharp and very important it does not rust.,1
2611,"Returned The Kindle Edition: This is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but in the Kindle edition the footnotes are not activated. Because of this you have to go to the end of the scene/act to look up a word, phrase, or historical data...then there is the issue of getting back to where you were before.Is it too much to ask for publishers to do their job, and stop producing substandard Kindle books thinking the consuming public will take whatever crap they offer us.Remember, Amazon allows us to return Kindle books withing a week of purchase. All you have to do is go to Manage Your Kindle and then find where all your books are kept, from there you go to the Actions Tab and select Refund.If we all begin to complain and return these books then publishers will get the message and begin to do their jobs correctly/thoughtfully.Again, this is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays but I am NOT going to stand for substandard eBooks anymore.",0

There is a PDA cellphone around the corner that it's just for you.Palm drop the ball and lost the opportunity to keep their leadership in the market with ugly products like it's cell phones, and really nice products like this TX that are just out of touch with the market",0
2613,"don't waste your money: Oh my gosh, this is by far the worst sound machine I have ever seen. It comes with batteries and so you would think that it would run on batteries but they are only for shipping and the demo mode...makes no sense to me. the buttons do not wok properly, you have to mash them several times to make the connection.",0
2614,"Good, light, often humorous drama: We've enjoyed all of the seasons as each of the characters brings something special. Sorry to read that most of the cast won't be back.",1
2615,"Lazy summer beach music great: Rhino compilations are usually interesting and this is one of the better samplings of South Carolina ""Beach Music"" -- the stuff enjoyed to during summer shore vacays. Definitely nostalgic -- the Drifters, the Coasters, Archie Drell, Clovers, etc., it's worth the listen many times over",1
2616,"Doors finally rocking and wild: This is not the perfect Doors album. It doesn't have much of a sheen. Heck, it's raw, loose and mean. I've been waiting for this one. The Doors on an average night with the singer going, going...but it's toughness belies an attitude straight out of Doors mythology. Love it, hate it, doesn't matter much. It's rock and roll, baby and I'm listening.",1
2617,"Very Disappointing: ...I was greatly disappointed by ""Healing With the Angels."" It took only a few hours to read and contained very little practical or new information. ... About half of the book consists of unimpressive excerpts of Ms. Virtue's ""angel readings"" with clients and hokey little ""prayers"" that you may as well make up yourself. ...If you are looking for a book that contains solid information on improving your life and developing your intuition, buy ""Divine Guidance"" instead.",0
2618,"Please don't buy!: After having read the previous review i made the gamble and bought the book. Please don't make the same mistake. The book laks proffessionalism, instructions and originality. The book is a lousy collection of pictures of low grade food carvings, and gives no or minimal instructions on how to recreate them. if it was not for all the hassle and costs involved this book would have been returned on the same day as received!",0
2619,"Am I the only one confused?: This book will only make you angry at yourself for continually expecting it to somehow get better. Bad medicine,bad story telling,and incomplete resolution. I can't even loan this to a friend- I'd be embarrassed to have them think I liked it.",0
2620,A must have in a songwriters library...: This book does an excellent job of breaking down many of the topics that an aspiring songwriter needs to take into consideration before deciding whether to pursue the music industry. It also does a good job of demonstrating how to construct songs with strong lyrics.,1
2621,Not a good choice: The perfect solution spinning remote control organizer looks nice and the spinning is OK if your too lazy to reach over to get a remote control. The big problem I had and I know other wrote about later is the side holders are just too small to accept most remote controls. I had only one out of five it could hold in it side pocket. I don't like to say bad things about a product but this was not designed with reality in mind.,0
2622,"This mill has a fatal flaw: I never imagined I would splurge and buy a pricey pepper mill, but have always wanted a good one. But when I got a Amazon.com gift certificate, I couldn't resist. I like the idea of a ceramic grinding mechanism, adjustable grinding size, and heavy stainless construction. When it arrived, I filled it with peppercorns, and turned it 1/2 turn. It broke. The method for connecting the top of the mill to the stainless steel shaft is a weak plastic part. Since it came apart when it broke, I could see that I was lucky mine broke immediately, so I could return it. There is no way this mechanism would hold up for extended use. And when you pay this much for a pepper mill, you want extended use. Don't buy it.",0
2623,"old movie: An old move and rather cheesy. Not the sellers fault, but it did not have much about the Grand Canyon which was why we bought.",1
2624,Dewalt portable table saw: I am very pleased with this saw. I have had it about 7 years and it continues to serve me well. I bought a good Forrester blade (3/16 kerf) which uses less power. The spindle runs true .... .003 runout when last measured. The only thing needed maintenance wise is to clean and lubricate the height adjustment screw located under the saw. The height becomes very hard to adjust otherwise.,1
2625,Horrible reception: Paired with a Motorola Razr V3c. It does nothing but crackle and make noise when phone is within 2 feet of the unit! This may work with other motorola phones but it didn't with mine. (Note: my platronics unit NEVER had this problem with this phone). I would not buy again unless Jabra fixes this problem.,0
2626,"Fox News Worldview: If you love Fox News, listen to Limbaugh, Hannity, and Liddy you will love this book. It's really just more of the same ""America, love it or leave it"" crap we heard during the Vietnam War era. Goldberg is an angry and bitter man who had a humor by-pass operation somewhere along the way as was evidenced during his book promotion appearance with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. It seems that people with his worldview are incapable of objectivly hearing criticism about the polices of our country without feeling the whole idea of America is threatened. I would suggest the author expand the list and include himself.",0
2627,"Watch out! It falls apart!: Firts the arm fell off, then the front of the other arm fell off. The back felt unsafe and I was afraid to rock my son in it. We were finding screws here and there. I'm glad we found them before our son did!! Not the most expensive but turned out to be the worst! My sister bought one from Wal-mart that lasted longer! Think hard before choosing this one!",0
2628,"Hard coating with a soft centre: This album has 2 maybe 3 good songs on it...if you're more into ja's R+B type songs...ever since Venni Vetti Vecci he's been getting weaker and weaker...this a great example of a good rapper become too commercialised...Basically you can see through the lyrics on this album like a window..ja's tried way too hard and came up with an album i would'nt spit on....my advice is go and buy venni vetti vecci, or even better go get yourself anything by DMX",0
2629,"He's Done It Again: I was some of the fortunate one's to get an advance copy. I spent the next few days listening to this album. Once again Eminem has done it again. He gets you ready with ""White America"" where he talks about Tipper Gore, President Bush and wife Laura, Congess, and Dick Cheany's wife. And he keeps you on the edge of your seat until ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"" in which he has his daughter (Hailie Jade) on the track. Tracks like ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" (in which he talks about his mother, his wife, and his father), ""Sing For The Moment"" (A sample of Aerosmith's ""Dream On""), ""Without Me"" (which he spits the venom on Chris Kirkpatrick of 'NSync, Moby, and Limp Bizkit), and ""Hailie's Song"" (in which he actually sings) have you wondering what's next. With guest spots by D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Hailie Jade, and Obie Trice. This is an album that parents will hate and the children will want.",1
2630,"Nice & Thin But Leaked Too Much: I tried these and they are nice and thin but everytime I would nurse on one side, the other side would have a let down and I would leak through or soak the pad everytime. This means that in the beginning I would go through a box every 5-7 days because I can't stand that wet feeling. That can get really expensive!I didn't want to use the cloth pads much because they get soaked just as easily and here in Hawaii that means you can get thrush or infections due to the humidity.I switched to using Lilypadz. They actually stop the leaking by applying slight pressure. IT IS SO NICE TO BE DRY!!! They are $20 a pair but they are not disposable so you just rinse and reuse. They really helped me to stop night leaking. Also, you can wear swimsuits, and lingerie without having to wear a nursing bra. They work really well as long as they are applied properly.",0
2631,"Not for Canvas or Cordura: I bought this to label the equipment bags for our local Little League. Being that it is a fabric paint I assumed it would apply a nice thick coat of paint. Instead, it had the consistency of milk and was mostly absorbed by the canvas material that the bags were made of. I sprayed three coats on the bag hoping I would get a nice thick visible bag number to appear. That never happened so I conclude that this product must be meant for some other type of fabric that won't absorb it.",0
2632,Training Video on Target: This training video is superb.The level of detail is almost always on target. Each new section begins with a broader perspective and then narrows down to repeatable lessons that bring home the concepts. Howard almost always starts with a blank project so every detail is covered; there are no mysteries left over.I think this is the most effective video training I have ever seen.,1

Give it a try, I'm sure happy that we did!",1
2635,"Empathy and practical information: Fibromyalgia for Dummies has great info on what causes fibromyalgia, what it really feels like (with many anecdotes from people with fibromyalgia) and what you can DO about it, including medications, lifestyle changes, and much more. And if your doctor thinks fibromyalgia is a pretend problem (as some still do), the book tells you how to find a new doctor who understands and will help you. Written in the easy-to-understand style of the Dummies, the authors explain fibromyalgia in a caring and helpful way, with a thorough and illustrated discussion of key diagnostic terms, such as the tender points of fibromyalgia. If you have fibromyalgia or think that you may have it, you need Fibromyalgia for Dummies.",1
2636,"They took a chance on Chance: Chance the gardener has nowhere to go once ""the old man"" dies. Is he even related to ""the old man"", he doesn't know. He doesn't know anything really. He knows tv and the garden and the house. He's never left the house and now he must. In doing so, odd circumstances continue to allow him to get by... more than get by actually, he becomes a superstar - Chauncey Gardner. Quoted and loved by the most important people in the world even though he says very little. No one seems to notice that they've made someone into thee next big thing without knowing a thing about him until it's too late. By then... well what to do?It's a brilliant movie though a scene or two did feel a little slow, otherwise perfect.",1
2637,Monster Cable 126130 iCable for iPod: I don't believe this is a Monster Cable product. The RCA connections didn't fit the female connection firmly.,0
2638,"A Good beginning: First I must say some listeners may need extra patience,as well as a wide scope of liked music to listen to this bands debut album.It includes the classic ""Nights in White Satin"" along with its ending poem ""Last Lament"".If you like classical music done by an orchestra,well,the band sure doesn't miss that.The album is done with the London symphony orchestra.The intro is enjoyable as it moves into the other music here and is pretty well matched everywhere.Problem is,with only 7 total songs,that orchestra takes over a little too much of what the band is capable of in their own right.",1
2639,"Good points but not for everyone: A great read. Very thought provoking. However, I was taught from a very young age that you never, ever casually open someone else's refrigerator and take food without asking. It doesn't matter if its the refrigerator of close family or your best friend. It's bad manners and very disrespectful. So the idea of ""Refrigerator Rights"" doesn't resonate with me AT ALL. Though the points in this book make sense in today's world, not everyone enjoys being around a lot of people and that doesn't mean such people are ""limited"" in how much enjoyment they get out of life. I took exception to the author's apparent belief that self-reliance is bad. You can't always lean on others.",0

Find another there are many more.",0
2644,"Wicked was a real downer.: After obtaining tickets to see the stage show ""Wicked"" with my grandchildren, I ordered this book to learn how it related to the earlier OZ books. I forced myself to finish it, but have talked with other people who gave up on it. It is depressing with far too much angst; Dorothy doesn't appear until about page 375 and is hardly the brave little girl in the real Oz books. Fortunately, the story line in the stage show was changed and the characters fitted my expectation of characters from Oz. Save your money on this book and buy tickets to the show.",0
2645,"Do not waste your money :(: I purchased this based on the picture and description. The price was good. I was disappointed quickly once they arrived. This watch looks good and has a good a solid feel ... outside ... however, once you start playing with you see the problems quickly:- Crown is so loose I would be really worried to expose it to any wet conditions (not even talking about washing my hands)- The crown winding did not work - tried multiple times - stopped after 1 minute of running.I have returned the watch. I was particular disappointed as you can get a nice Seiko or Citizen for this price and those would work forever.In short - do not waste your time and money and get Seiko or a Citizen.",0

They haven't yet made a decent program of this war, not that it's a very interesting war, but it's odd that no one is prepared to make a docmentary about the only republican government in England and the only civil war if you don't count the war of the roses, which was more a dynastic struggle. Please someone in England I know it's a banned subject, but can you make a program about this war worth watching.",0

Customer service was great, I got another one in a couple of days with the same issues broken and incomplete packing. I was able to get a working unit out of the two that were sent. The biggest complaint now is that the handle will not stay attached to the tank I have a ""portable"" unit that is anything but portable! I cannot move it anywhere without reseating the handle every couple of feet! In all not worth the aggrevation.",0

As I listen to it now, I'm still in awe of its power.At Thrash Metal's peak, when bands moved past the fastest-riff-ever and gothic tones to more meaningful topics and much more mature music, PWYP stands out in a small cluster of releases by an even smaller cluster of artists that to me, truly defined the power of the music and the message it could convey. I miss those days.",1
2655,"Little Walter: His Best: Beginning his career performing his masterful harmonica playing in Muddy Waters' band, Little Walter broke out on his own with his 1952 hit ""Juke."" From there Walter's amplified sound (which he originated) became a common entity of Chicago blues. This best-of collection selects the cream of the crop from mostly Walters 1950's sessions recorded for the Chess label; revealing him not only as a divine harmonica player, but as a skilled songwriter as well.Included on the album are classic numbers such as the bouncing rhythm of the aforementioned ""Juke"", the wailing harmonica of ""Blues With A Feeling"", and the hopping ""My Babe"", a song penned by the great Willie Dixon, becoming the biggest hit of Walter's career in early 1955.In addition, three photographs and six pages of insightful,well written notes by Billy Altman are included. Although a few noteworthy numbers are absent, this collection remains a fine testament of one of the founding fathers of Chicago Blues.",1

Historical fiction and non-fiction is a personal favorite of mine, and this book didn't let me down.

By the time they see each other again, their lives have become gloriously entangled.Told from the standpoint of both lovers (more from Mary), and key mutual friend of theirs, a well-developed early-teen character. More humor than usual from GLH. Best written of what I've seen so far, and tied for my favorite of hers with about eight other stories.",1
2669,"The definitive version of Free Bird!: I think it is important for any fan of Skynyrd to listen to Winona's cover of their classic, because it is quite simply the best version of that song ever recorded. Not only are her vocals incredible, but the guitar break in the middle of the piece is the most remarkable piece of guitar work I have ever heard. It is clear that the musicians who put this guitar piece together were honoring Skynyrd in the best way possible. If you don't buy it, try to listen to this one song -- you won't be sorry!",1

I used a 20 oz bottle yet it was still sickeningly sweet (note: the water was chilled; after tasting, I put it over ice--still gross). But the worst was yet to come. 10 minutes after the two tastes, a HORRIBLE SPLENDA HEADACHE--much worse than any aspartame headache to date.Note: No problem with the sweetener in the other ""to go"" varieties I've tried. No idea why this pne is so horrid.",0

I quit around page 200, and I commend those that went further.Disguising itself as an erotica book, but failing in every possible way in that aspect? Check. Bland, boring, grating prose? Check. Laughable dreary Mary-Sue of a main character? Check. Raping a major religion because author lacked any creativity? Check! I could go on, but you get the point.This book is bad Alternate Universe Biblical fanfic. I thought, in the beginning it might get better, but it actually got more boring, more repetitive and just downright annoying for me to give it any of my attention any longer. I think I need to read some Nabokov to cleanse my brain.",0

I guess you can have a career based on a classless reputation, zero singing and acting skills, and arms bigger than Arnold S' and the Incredible Hulk's combined.

2681,"EDV-110 review: I have had this little unit for a year now and it really does remove moisture. It's farley quiet and can not sleep well at night without something running in my room. The only thing that keeps it from getting all 5 stars is that the humidity will not go down any lower than 60 per cent. I would like to get it more like 50 per cent. Maybe I need a bigger unit that removes more pints of water. Over all its a very well made and runs smooth. I like that has a DC brushless fan. They are tough, long lasting fans that usually never fail. I also like the size. I had a big heavy one that was overkill for my room. I hope you keep making good quality products. I strongly recommend this unit.",1
2682,"Surprisingly great album!: This is an excellent album for anyone who is getting sick of the more traditional Christmas music. Blackmore's Night does some very original-sounding renditions of Christmas songs with great instrumentation. The ocharina on ""I Saw Three Ships"" is particularly enchanting. This album includes ""Wish You Were Here,"" which was a pleasant surprise. I lent this album to a friend and didn't get it back, which I would take as a positive endorsement...",1

Now it does not work at all.",0

Probably super duper for those with gas grills.",1

Being newly diagnosed, she had no idea about counting carbs and food exchanges, etc. and she said this book really helped her understand all of those things. My mom also recently visited a nutrionist who told her that she was really glad she had the book to refer to because it is perfect for people in her situation and provides the important information that newly diagnosed diabetics should know.

2689,"Unbelieveably boring & irrelevant: I have read hundreds if not thousands or true crime books. I've been to law school and specifically studied female serial killers. This book is badly written. It is organized poorly. However, ultimately it has a catchy title with no backing. It mentions black magic three or four times and really doesn't dwell on how it deals with the deaths. For that matter, I'm not even sure I'd convict her. She may be crazy but it doesn't mean she isn't crazy like a fox and that undercover work like you see in Ann Rule and Aphrodite Jones books just isn't found here. This is a boring book that I prayed would real some nugget of information (but didn't) before it ended and then literally threw it away--it's not worth the passage to others or even the space on my bookshelf. I had assumed that a professional newspaper journalist with the back ground that this writer has would produce a better book, but it didn't happen.",0

2693,"An intersting Story of a Trinidad long ago.: I read this book about 8 years ago, as part of my literature curriculum. At that age, the reading, was at most, a trivial one, where the plot was more important than the backdrop of themes and metaphors.Today, Earl Lovelace's book serves as an important reminder of the corruptibility of society, and the moral decadence that usually comes with power.Set in Trinidad and Tobago, it is not as culturally emblematic as Selvon's ""A Brighter Sun."" Nonetheless it is situationally relevant and non-anachronistic for the purpose of conveying the tragedy of a crushed dream - one, the victim of hope.",1
2694,Not Happy: I got this model because it was cheaper than the foodsaver models and it was cheaper for a reason. I could not get the lid to lock intoplace hence the machine would not work.

2696,"A great little day-pack!: I used this pack for the 39.3 mile two-day Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in Washington DC. It served me exceedingly well. It's nice and small, not bulky, and very light - yet it has lots of pockets and pouches to put things. I carried a 50oz Camelbak, two cell phones, two backup batteries, an MP3 player and two speakers, extra clothing (socks, underwear, jacket), snacks, and a first aid kit with me. This pack was small enough to carry without feeling like a pack mule, and large enough to fit all that stuff which made the walk so much better.I highly recommend this as a day pack for people that are looking for something to carry around, for example in a theme park, during day hikes, etc. It was well worth the money, and has stood up to some pretty rigorous uses already.",1

I was sorry that I WASTED my money on STATIC X teh day before but was glad that I discovered Slipknot. MUST own!!!

In fact, for a person who can never pick a favorite song or a favorite movie (because there are too many to choose from) - I have determined that track #8, Keep Me, will be my wedding song. The lyrics are beautiful, the vocals and inflection are romantic and it's just perfect. I have yet to listen to other Kim Richey albums, but I'm ordering ""The Collection"" today because I have a feeling she will be my favorite artist. What I don't understand is why Kim Richey doesn't get more play with that beautiful sound? Oh wait, maybe it should stay that way. ;o)",1

These are the newborn flow ones and although they are the slowest, it's still not slow enough. I'm trying to breast feed and sometimes he just gets impatient with me (I have a low supply) and wants the bottle. Sometimes I oblige depending on how loud he is and how tired I am.But these are easy to clean and switch out too. I bought these to put into some ""2"" nipples I had since I got a set of these avent bottles.",1
2703,"A disappointing show by LA studio musicians: Way back in 1984, after seeing ""Blade Runner"" many times at a college theater, I tracked down what I thought was the soundtrack to Ridley Scott's eye-popping film. It was a big mistake, since the sounds that emerged from this record bore little resemblance to Vangelis' music. Since then I've bought the official Vangelis score, but on occasion the New American Orchestra version creeps back into my memory. Some things take a while to get over! Vangelis, you made us wait a long time... but it was worth it.",0
2704,Disappointed: The movie wasn't bad. This is my favorite book in the series and I wad a little disappointed in the translation to the movie. A lot... more than necessary was cut out. But the reason I'm overly dissatisfied is there are no special features... the documentry was cool.. thewedding video was a good idea in theory And that was basically it. This is the only twilight DVD without deleted scenes. Which perhaps is the boat disappointing considering what was cut out.,0
2705,"Bibilical Meaning of this Epsiode: It seems to me that this Episode has some Bibilical meaning in similarity within it. Think about it, Counsellor Troi acts like a Virgin Mary, and her son, Ian, is the Child Jesus, who sacrifices himself to save the rest of the crew of the Enterprise. Makes sense, No? I'd say this is one of the best episode I've ever seen. It's very touchy.Thanks, bye!",1

Well, apparently Santa was listening because just 2 days after Christmas, there it was on Amazon; just waiting for me.This workout is just that - a workout! For those that think yoga is easy and you don't get good exercise from it, they should definitely try this. Bob does strength moves for your whole body, leaving you feeling stronger, fitter, and a little tired at the end. This is a great addition to any workout video collection!",1

2711,so so: i belive that while this may not be the best book you have ever read it is still worth reading. i thought that while the overall plot was better then eragon but it just didnt have that flow to it that made eragon such a huge success. this book does have a few interesting moments like during eragons training and the final battle. but all in all the grand suprise of this book was really predictable in my opinion but still will work out nicely for the next book. i belive that the 3rd book shows promise if he writes it correctly. all in all i am hoping that this book was just building up for the next book. i do not belive it is as good as last but i know many people will like it a lot.,1

I have always beenable to share them with my grandchildren and always knew therewas nothing I had to worry about thatthey shouldn't hear.This is a total departure from the goodclean family entertainment of the otherbooks. Even though there are some really good parts it is ruined by thesmut that is inserted all through thebook. Now I can no longer share thisone with others in my family. I don't understand why they felt itneccessary to ruin a good book by making it R rated. I was very disappointed in it.Laura Robertson,0
2714,"Recycling is a good practice - but not on ""different"" CD's: Having enjoyed other similar ""Solitudes"" CD's in the past, I was looking forward to this one. However, while listening to it, I realized some of the music was the same music used on the CD, ""Algonquin Suite."" I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, so I listened again, then played the AS CD and in one section, it was the same music, redubbed onto ""Island Paradise."" Granted, the nature sounds were different - but it seems someone has taken a short cut or two by just remixing old music tracks with new sounds. While the entire CD is not the exact same music, hearing even one music track that had already been featured on another disc, set in a different natural environment, really did take away much of the enjoyment for me. I won't be purchasing any of their works in the future.",0

I've read it many times and each time I've grown more appreciative. Though often dry and lacking eye candy it's the closest thing to sitting in a classroom in 15th century Florence. Modeling by Edouard Lanteri and the follow up volume 2 are truly the foundation of nearly every instructional book in print. Long before the overly intellectualized works attempting to pass for art there were sculptors that could actually sculpt.

If the traditional instruments (cornemuse, harp, flutes, etc.) that are present in Breton music interest you, their inclusion in the music is seamless.

Once the CD was in my hands, i listened to nothing else for months. It was a transformative experience; I am not a fan of female voices, nor of the female presence on stage. Her songwriting, pendulates from ridiculous and slightly precious to odd and somewhat somber reflections on animals. Anyway, I love it...",1
2743,"Practice material did not correspond with actual GRE: I had taken the GRE in 1999 on paper. When I was preparing to re-take the GRE, I bought this book to understand the changes in the test and to practice on the computer. My practice scores were excellent (far exceeding my performance in 1999), so I went into the actual test expecting to do well. However, my verbal score was 80 points below what it was in 1999, and 120 points below my average practice test from the CD-ROM. While the information for the analytical section was helpful, the verbal reasoning practice sections and vocabulary are not challenging enough. You would do well to look elsewhere for verbal practice.",0

Brian DePalma does a fantastic job in his directorial debut of this Stephen King classic. While watching, you empathize and want to become her.

The author (and I use that term VERY loosely) apparently had a bitter divorce and has used his anger toward the ex-wife as a means to debase all women.The arrogance is astounding. From the misogynistic thread that runs rampant throughout the text to the obvious cruelty, it is truly a sad commentary on where we have gone as a society.",0
2752,"A Wealth of Information: As a concerned father of two boys, I found this book to be an extremely useful starting point for educating myself about the current state of American schools. McEwan does a wonderful job of wading through the educational jargon, identifying the major issues being debated today, and giving a brief history of the evolution of public schools in the US. The book is full of relevant anecdotes and is heavily footnoted.While McEwan makes no secret of her traditionalist views, her critical treatment of progressivism is abrupt and consequently shallow. My suspicion is that many of the progressivist ideas have merit, but incompetent implementation of those ideas has resulted in such prominent failures that the ideas themselves are condemned. McEwan simply fails to make this distinction.Overall, though, this was a great book that defied me to put it down.",1

From initial training, to all the maintenance stuff, etc. The Thunderbirds DVD touches on these things, but doesn't have nearly as much detail as the blue angels one.

Even though it doesn't really teach you much WRITTEN Japanese, it is by far excellent in teaching vocabulary and especially the confusing grammar of Japanese. My only complaint is that unless you can think of ways to make it fun, you could easily get bored with it. The book is very straightforward and doesn't offer the fun that I think other methods of learning the language (subtitled videos, songs, etc.) can offer.

2758,"Slower & jazzier than last album, but still wonderful.: Hart Rouge's latest album, in some ways, departs from the style they set on their previous recording, ""Beaupre's Home."" It has a generally slower tempo. The arrangements are more complex, with more emphasis on the instrumentals and less on the lush vocals. It has a jazzier feel to it. None of these departures is a negative, ""Nouvelle France"" is a thoroughly enjoyable CD, well worth the price of admission. It retains many ofthe elements that made ""Beaupre's Home"" unique and interesting -- great lyrics sung both in English and French (and sometimes both in the same song or phrase), strong harmonies and a very intriguing, mostly acoustic sound.",1

Another thing to bear in mind is that she uses a lot of stereotypes, especially about homosexuals, which could be found offensive.

I don't mind operatic singing, but it just doesn't belong in a lightweight film like this.",0
2780,No regrets!!!: I recently bought this item during the sales of black Friday and have no regrets!! It makes a great cup of Joe each and every time. Only issue I have so far is that in order to fill your travel mug you have to run the cycle twice using two k cups which is not a big deal when u think about it because it's still cheaper than buying the same size at your local coffee shop. The clean up process is very easy and fast. Just a simple wipe down and rinse of the water reservoir and that's it!I would recommend this product to anyone that considers themselves a coffee enthusiast on the run. With so many different varieties of k cups on the market your taste buds will never get bored!,1

I used this to re-do the fuel lines on several weed-whackers where the tubing goes into the fuel tank, so it is completely immersed, inside and out. The tubing in the gasoline swelled up to double its original size! This meant that the filter attached to it slipped off. It hasn't completely dissolved, however and the parts outside the tank seem okay and haven't swelled up, but I am going to replace all of them as soon as I get some replacement Tygon tubing.",0

I couldn't find any info on a lawsuit, BUT...I recently saw a quote about ""Uris BASED Mila 18 on The Wall"". I guess that relieves Uris from plagerism problems.

I would recommend anything and everything he has published. I love his approach to metaphysical material - you can tell he speaks from experience an not hearsay when he delves into topics. He offers different points of view and allows you to decide in what resonates with you best.Specifically in this book, I appreciated how often he reiterated the core of Reiki - that you can't do any harm with it. Often times in our culture there is an association of fear in regards to energy work, and he really conveyed a sense of safety when exploring this.This is one of my favorites, for sure. It explores Reiki so well, and helps people to see that sometimes a certain energy can have many names, but the results are the same. Very empowering.",1

Each character has his or her own special trademarks, from the sad old anorak Nige to the sexed up Lorraine. This book has it all. There are a few characters that stick out most in my mind. Firstly, Pertti van Helden. He is a CEO in Finland. His cultural differences make his character all the more interesting. Another character I enjoyed was Liam. His quips made me smile. A lot.As for good scenes, there are too many for me to mention. All I can say is, if you buy this book, look out for the scene with Simon Horne and his ""lady"" friend. <BG>Great Read!",1

He's got twelve weeks of workouts planned, three days a week. Every exercise is explained thoroughly, complete with pictures and pointers on common mistakes. The workouts are also great.

2790,Study of The Brain...: I used to like this Roots album when it first came out but now going back trying to listen to it...it has lost its flair quickly. VERY quickly. I don't know what it is though...maybe it's the demo esque feel of the songs. The only songs I'm still feelin is Sacrifice and break You Off. They either feel incomplete or they feel like they run on forever. Or maybe it's just too many rock influences for my taste. Or maybe the rhymes on this album are sorta lacking. Maybe the Roots ARE just going through the motions. Whatever it is though it's causing me to despise this album. Stick with the other Roots albums for enjoyment and only get this cd to complete a collection (The bonus DVD was also a nice addition). That's the honest Truth.,0

Happily, the rest of the film unfolds just as creatively, with some of the finest storytelling I've seen in a long, long time. Pixar's graphics work is stylistic and skillful. Its the one area that you have to respect in any Pixar film. However, in ""Up"", the graphics support a powerful, moving tale about an elderly man who has lost everything and a young boy who is troubled by a broken family. Typically, 5-star reviews are overused but in the case of ""Up"", its well deserved. I very highly recommend this film.",1

It's so much better to have a switch-out ensemble instead of yet another appliance.It's better than a stand alone juicer, and my juice always comes out cold and fresh.Some advice for this item:I did find that for cleaning, the thing that works the best is a bottle brush, the kind with the sponge at the end, and you clean going with the blades, so you don't shred your sponge. It also gets all the pulp out of the mesh.I also found that feeding the items in slowly, and then letting it run for a couple of minutes gets out the max amount of juice. If you have any smaller add-in's like ginger, you have to put it through first so that the flavor doesn't get lost in the build up of pulp.

2804,"Anachronistic Festival: I can't believe that the guy who did Stargate and Independence Day could put out this loser. First, the story line is a ripoff of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. Then, the constant anachronisms make it irritating to watch. 10,000 BC and you have guys riding horses and carrying metal swords. The Bronze Age was still a few thousand years away. Pyramid building in the age of the sabertooth and wooly mammoth! Yikes! I assume the story was taking place on the African continent because of all the African tribes; the heroes had to cross what looked like the Sahara desert, but at 10,000 BC the Sahara was a great big grassland. On and on these anachronisms went, so many that it was impossible to maintain the suspension of disbelief that is necessary to get into a movie.

I can tell already that after any prolonged period of time, hearing the same comments over and over again could potentially become tedious. This is why I gave it only 4 stars. And I wouldn't recommend it too highly to anyone who is in fantastic shape, unless of course they wanted to use it as a nice warm up. But all in all it is a nice workout. So far, I'm very happy",1
2806,"What a disappointment!: I ordered this book because the plot sounded so promising, and because it supposedly was a best-seller in Europe. Perhaps it was translated from the French -- that would explain the plodding, dull prose. The conversations had no hint of the speakers' personalities. Much like Mary Higgins Clarks characters, they all spoke with the same tone. Real people don't speak in long paragraphs. The characters were flat, the setting seemed more of a soap opera set than real life, and the story was unconvincing. The ending was the predictable happily-everafter stuff of a Harlequin Romance.

2807,"Canvas is NOT the way to go: This bag gets two stars because it has very sturdy French seams and the bias-cut canvas can withstand all manner of treatment, but that's all this bag has going for it. I've used it for piping frostings and icings several times now, and everything leaks through the bag onto my hands, precluding a good grip and getting sugary grease on everything I touch (makes for an epic mess to clean up). Contrary to another review on this product, canvas is NOT the way to go-it is a loosely woven fabric, so the filling leaks between the threads. Also, the bottom of the bag is just a wee bit too big to fit my standard couplers, so frosting leaks out between the bottom of the bag and the top of the piping tip. Another problem is the finished bottom seam, making the fabric there very thick. Even if it did fit standard couplers, the seam is too thick to properly screw on a coupler ring.

I use it all the time! Great value for the money. I would happily buy one again (20+ years from now when the warranty runs out).",1
2811,"Good product: I was doubtful about liking this, but I bought it anyway. It is nutty and good. I just add a little butter, salt, and pepper. I don't want to wait the long time it takes to cook on a regular stovetop. I've read articles that state that brown rice is better than white rice for diabetics, too, so, if that is an issue for you, or could be, take that into consideration.",1
2812,"Way Too Easy: I had played gallop racer, which was awesome. So I decided to get NTRA because I had played xbox most often and enjoyed horse racing. But I was wrong in getting this. This game is sooo boring!! You could win races with your eyes closed, literally. It seems almost impossible to lose, the breeding isnt that fun, and pretty much the whole game itself isnt that fun. I was expecting a lot more from this game. So take my advice and get one of the Gallop Racer games for Playstation, they are way better.",0
2813,Easily one of the worst books I ever read: The man has a god complex and basically only talks about himself and how his drug trips are better than your drug trips. I felt like he was talking down to me the whole time. I read a good chunk and I could not even finish it. Garbage.,0

The first set was perfect and exactly like in the picture with one slot in the shaft for the bearings in the driver chuck to connect. I liked it, and ordered another to have one in a dedicated portable tool chest. The second set was ordered using the same link, but was not the same socket adapters at all. There were two slim slots in the shaft and got immediately stuck in my dewalt 18 volt impact driver. I had to rip it out with the assistance of vice-grips and persistent knocking with a second wrench. The first set is nice, but the second almost damaged my far more expensive tool.",0

2817,"Works, But Not The Best Quality: I bought the Krusell Active Multidapt to protect my Sony Ericson from falls, scratches, etc. It did the job, and I used it for about 2 years.Pro'sProtected the phone very well.Con'sThe plastic that covers the screen and keys is cheaply made and began cracking from everyday use. Takes away from the sleek look of the phone and makes it look bulky and not as attractive. You have to open a flap on the back to use the camera if I am remembering correctly.Overall its not a bad protective case, but I would buy something different next time.Read my reviews - Buy with confidence",0
2818,"A psycologist's point of view...?: Big disappointment! I found very little material in this book usable. It is written for the academic reader (written by academics) accustomed to linking factual data to more factual data concluding with an 'educated' idea of how to do something. It is written using plenty of psycho-babble, with plenty of 'what to do' to confuse any possible rendering of a full resolution to the issue of natural cold call jitters. I found this book to be useless and of very little value.",0
2819,"Terrific book on important subject: Here's a useful addition to all the books out there because it covers a subject not often written about.

I have every ep on tape but the contrast on the DVD will be better! also one of my tapes looks worn out.I cant wait for the other seasons to come out.I like seasons 1 and 2 but seasons 3,4,and 6 are my favorites cause thats when it focuses on Finch played by the very funny and talented David Spade! I think the show is the funniest when it focuses on him! They are all great but I think david is the best one! Ill definitely be one of the first to buy this on the first day!!!!",1

The music here is not so much mellow as ""mature"" I heard someone say that the Oils are the band the Clash wish they could be if they played their instruments better. Well, their instruments are being put to good use here. Standouts include ""Underwater"", ""Surf's Up Tonight""""Bring on the Change"" and ""E-Beat"". The music has come a long way from their early punk roots but it sounds good, as opposed to their latest, ""Redneck Wonderland"", where it seems they heard too many accusations about them going soft and decided to crank out something as raunchy as possible. Either way, you won't be disappointed. Just get them.",1

2823,"Nice hand towel for keeping colds at bay.: No, there's nothing ""magical"" per se about these Wamsutta towels. The colors are pretty and don't run in the wash. They are soft, well-made (no strings or fraying so far), and a generous size.The thing I like about them, aside from the quality, is the PRICE. They're so inexpensive you can stock up and change the towel a few times a day if needed. So when one member of the family gets a cold, you have a ton of hand towels to keep the sick one from spreading the germs to the rest of you.Ever since I started buying up hand towels and assigning the color-coded towels to the husband and kids, the incidence of colds and other ailments as dropped dramatically. It's so nice to know that it isn't fated that one kid with the sniffles must spread it to everyone else!Yeah, it's a little thing, changing the hand towels all the time. But I can vouch that it's a great way to keep down the spread of germs and keep the family healthy.Stock up at these prices!",1

2826,"Just OK: The more talented members of this band went on to bigger and better things. The songs are pretty good, and the guitar/vocals/production all great. What really lets this band down is the terrible rhythm section. I'm not expecting George Hurley or anything, but when the drummer can't even keep time, you've got problems. You'll be just getting into a song and suddenly it speeds up/slows down/stumbles due to appalling drumming. Shame, as I really wanted to like it. Eventually cut my losses and put it on ebay.",0
2827,Good as advertised: Was weary about the product when ordering it since wanted a genuine Canon battery replacement and this was a little pricey.

2829,DISAPPOINTED: I purchased this based on the greatness of Baseball Mogul. I thought if it was half as engrosing it could be a good game. I would say that it is just a disappointment. There is not enough player detail. Maybe the future Football Moguls will be better.,0

With every new CD they've released I've been looking for that sound again, but have not found it. They get further and further away from what they're good at and have melded into the bland world of hip-hop pop where every song sounds the same. Far too bad! I miss the emotion and heavy drive of Rick's Road, one of the greatest CDs ever in my opinion.",0

I dunno, I'm waiting for replacements to find out.",0
2838,"Thin, outdated and overpriced: As a former contractor and consultant to the construction industry for over 35 years I must say that this book is of no value to anyone looking for more than a superficial survey of the subject of construction contract administration. Not only is the book thin on subject treatement, it is absurdly out of date. A checklist it offers was apparently written in the 1960's. Save your money.",0
2839,"Stupid, stinky, ridiculous and poorly written.: What a piece of dog doo. It is absolutely beyond me why this book is so popular. Who is the main character? Wouldn't it help to have a name for the narrator of the story, James? This book would be flunked by any English teacher in any college in the country. The stiff and lifeless dialogue will put anyone to sleep - as it did me, night after night. In fact, the piece of garbage is still on by bedside table.

I would consider her activity level to be normal for a 12-month-old, and she has remained safely sitting when I've used it. The seat easily wipes clean, is very light weight, and closes small enough to store almost anywhere. Another thing I like is that it can inflate so she's sitting higher, making it perfect for the dining table.I recommend this booster and think you'll be happy with it.",1

2851,"Whitley's ""Rocket House"" may take time to grow on you: At first, my reaction to this CD could be described best as, ""What the....??!""As I have listened more, and eased into the CD, I realize that Whitley as a songwriter, as a guitarist, and as a musician in general holds prime talent, but chooses to express it in unusual forms.While I'm not a big fan of drum machines, or fakebeat, I find that it lends a bit of a soothing impact among the slower songs such as ""Little Torch"" and ""Serve You"".Overall, the album may be difficult to step into at first... but I assure you, after playing it at least three times all the way through, you cant help but begin to love the sounds Whitley makes.",1
2852,"Sorry: more like jazz than zen...: First, this is a very short cd: only forty minutes. Second, although the string instrument(koto)sounds pretty much Eheiji-like, the flute, definitely the dominant instrument on this cd, sounds more like New Orleans jazz than zen, which is quite disturbing, to say the least. The first piece ends quite abruptly, which is a disaster if you are meditating.I was thoroughly disappointed and it was hard to remain calm and centered thinking of the wasted money. It landed in the garbage can after just one try.How other people could write raving comments about this cd is a something of a koan to me.I recommend Sanctuary by Riley Lee, which is real Japanese and Zen and is 61:19 minutes long!",0

I could only get the FM functionality to work, that's it!

2858,"Monk;No Chaser: It's just not possible that anyone has ever been more authentically cool than Thelonious Monk;he just had an unbeatable combination of the coolest name-and the composing skills,playing ability and ""street cred"" as one of bebop'sfounders to back it up. And, it's unlikely that there is a better documentary-on anybody-regardless of anyone's interest in jazz.While,Monk isn't shown playing his classic 'Straight,No Chaser',with his distinctive style,he is shown playing 'Round Midnight' while smoking a cigarette-which could get him shot today;the documentary was made in 1989 based largely on footage done in 1968.Monk died in 1982,married,but living in the home of Baroness Nica De Koenigswarter(Rothschild);she appears in this documentary and is definately a character who deserves a movie of her own.In any case,Monk is shown playing 'Pannonica' which he wrote for her.",1

The songs, most of which are rap songs, are really cute and amusing. The instrumentals are similarly ""cutesy"", and almost all of them are under a minute long (a few are less than ten seconds long). If you are a fan of this game, I'm sure you will enjoy the soundtrack.",1
2860,"Crash Bash is anti mod chip: Unforetunately I wasn't able to experience the boring repition of levels that my friends have complained about. MY particular problem was with the game even running, Sony has made sure this won't run on a PSX with a mod chip, even if you have purchased the game. People use mod chips for more than just piracy, some like to get advanced Japanese versions of games before they hit US stores, others contest their rights to make software backups. In either case new or backup this game detects the mod chip after booting and puts up a nice unfun stop message. I'd like to bash more than just Crash for this piece of anti-customer programming.",0
2861,"Disgusted at the lessons being taught young readers: This book is a fake. It purports to teach that compassion is all, but the compassion the ""Hero""(?) demonstrates serves merely to advance his position as head of a gang.

If so, why are we surprised when they act this way?",0

2864,"Love these pet mats: These pet mats are really nice, easy to clean and hold my greyhound's food bowl in place. The raised rim makes them great for any spills. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is I think they should come in other colors. This grey color works OK for us because it blends in OK with our flooring...but this may not be true for everyone, so that is why I give them 4 stars as some may like to choose a different color.",1

And the vocals from Megadeth and Sepultura are just plain shit. On a positive note is Type-O Negative. The original version of Black Sabbath is way overrated. I personally think it is just a flat out bad song. TON really does some work to it and makes it listenable. It is a good album even though i do'nt listen to a third of it.",1

2867,"Nice try, but too buggy: EA Sports has made a number of changes to the great sim, Superbike. While they have some nice graphics and physics going for them, it's just not well tested and sorted. One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the inconsistent difficulty levels of the tracks. If you play at a challenging level on one track, you'll be way faster than the field on the next. Other than that, the game just isn't up to modern standards. The menus are clunky and slow. The ""announcer"" is annoying and often gets it wrong. The sound files don't sound anything like race bikes. In the original game you could restart a race if you crashed. In SB 2000 the documentation claims you can still restart in single race mode, but that feature is not actually available. It's interesting that several other ""reviewers"" claim that you can still restart. Makes you wonder if they're gamers or marketers.",0

That was a bad decision. My Caruso stopped working after 1 month of VERY LIMITED use. It just died. I have no idea what happened but I'm not very happy about it.

I was quite disappointed from the outset. I am new to programming and while there were in depth explanations about some things, others were just introduced and then left hanging. I think the worst though, is that all chapter exercises are supposed to have answers on the web, and this is clearly stated in the book, yet as of today (20 Feb, 2001 - book printed October 2000) there are still no answers to any exercises anywhere on the ""official"" website for the book.

I just can't say to a friend that they have to see this great film I watched. It struck me in a very personal way, at the film's halfway point, involving Jolson and the young woman (the very underrated and forgotten actress Madge Evans). I'm an easy mark for that sort of story line especially with such an ending.I agree that it is Jolson's greatest performance....very likeable and underplayed. If you haven't seen it, watch it. You will either walk away not liking, or have a mediocre reaction, or liking it for a variety of reasons. For me, its uncompromised ending raises it above an enjoyable trifle.",1

The poster they sent me was a completely different picture of a similar but different cat with different colors and different wording on it! -Not the same picture as advertised at all! I was shocked that they found it similar enough to substitute in place of what is pictured online.

It was going nowhere. The story is completely lukewarm, there is no conflict, the characters don't inspire any sort of feeling, nothing makes your continue reading it.I think this was the most shameless attempt to get money from a beloved author that is no longer alive to defend herself.Skip this one... go read or reread Jane's books instead!",0

Recording without the guide is as clunky as your first VCR. Plus, the guide only goes out about 72 hours. Ask it to record a weekly series and it freaks out when it cannot find the next scheduled program in the guide. It is a dvd player, but those run about 50 bucks these days.

2880,"It actually works and that's a surprise: With a long history of many failed attempts at IP wireless cams, Linksys creates what others could not; one that works.Configuration with WEP was pretty easy. It's a little temperamental with distance compared to the tolerances of other G devices, but it works. It does not react well to low light levels and tries to compensate via its own gain. If you are using this in a home without AMPLE light, expect a grainy picture.Frame rate is about 20FPS and is annoying. The security feature works. It senses movement and mails a captured video file. With only 4 seconds at the medium setting, the video images were over 500Kb. This is not for a dial-up AOL user.There is a remote viewing option that lets you use their web servers to hit your cam from anywhere. Of course expect to pay about $40 for two years access.",1

2882,"Beware of leaks!: Well it is quiet, easy to fill and whatnot, but this thing seemed to humidify my room by soaking the carpet. I never moved the unit, followed the directions and it all seemed to be functioning normally... I refilled it once a day for a couple days and noticed that wet spots were popping up nearby the unit and later realised that it was constanty leaking water through the drain plug. So I put it in a plastic tub to catch the water and saw that about 2/3 of the water I had put in the tank was just running back out of the unit and down into the carpet padding. My guess is the plunger on the drain cap was defective, but regardless it is a huge and messy disappointment! After throwing it away, (I lost the receipt), and cleaning the carpet extensively I would reccomend getting a different humidifier.",0
2883,"Nice enclouses, but keep them ventelated.: These enclosures do a great job at keeping the drives cool. I have four of them stacked on top of each other, but the enclosures were getting almost too hot to touch. I've added some spacers between the drives to allow for air to circulate between them and they are much cooler.If you leave the your drives on all of the time and plan on sleeping in the same room, forget it. The blue LED on the front is blindingly bright at night, let alone having four of them.I use the enclosures with drives I use for video editing and have not had one fail yet. (knock on wood). The power supplies are inline and have regular plugs on the end, meaning you have no wall-warts to deal with.",1

2889,"Pleasant music: This recording offers pleasant, very accessible music that blends occidental and oriental sound. The violinist is quite good, and the orchestra backs her up competently. While the storyline for the Butterfly Lovers suggests operatic tragedy, the music is, on the whole, cheerful. This disc makes for enjoyable listening without requiring the listener to concentrate too intently.",1
2890,"4 and a half stars: I think 4 and half would be accurate.What you need to know is that all the companies put out their own comparisons - it is annoying. Multipure claims that Aquasana does not filter out a bunch of stuff - that seems to be reported incorrectly. I give minor props to Aquasana for not attacking the competitor.The real skinny is that Aquasana had problemw with their casing and the faucet leaking over time. Both seem to be resolved. Over time (I have used AQ for about 5 years) whenever I had a problem I called support and they sent me a replacement immediately at no charge with no hassle. Even when they changed the faucet type for the undersink style, they sent me all the new stuff no charge. As much as a hassle as it was to replace the stuff it wss done immediately no questions.PS the water tastes great.",1

2893,"Director cuts out the good stuff: I have to disagree with the director and with Amazon. The voice-over was great and lent character and atmosphere to the original. Of course, the ending is better and there are some interesting new scenes with Sean Young and Harrison Ford, but Ford's voice and the Vangelis score melded into a wonderful future film noir experience.",1
2894,"Please read this book!: Before I read this book I was your average ""Sunday morning Christian"". I did not really know what it meant to be a Christian.

I can't believe how RL grabs the reader from the first page and has the reader hanging on by their fingernails at the end of every chapter. I was so impressed by this book, when I discovered there were two sequels to the Bourne Identity, I immediately purchased them. They were not dissapointing either--two more weeks of sleepless nights trying to reach the thrilling climax at the end of each book! If you love high speed espionage with chases, the beautiful female love interest, and the antagonist disquised as an evil devil that 'good' has to overcome, then I highly encourage you to run to the closest bookstore or library and get your own copy!",1
2899,"Probably the best biography of Prophet Muhammad ever written: This is probably the best biography of Prophet Muhammad ever written. A must-read, and must-have. Wonderful resource. I have read it more than once and yet it yields more each time - and so have found it to be a valuable gift to give to friends : a wonderful account of his life and the beginnings of Islam, and the inner and outer journeys, that is absorbing, simple and yet multi-levelled. Devoid of any kind of prejudice, an open and true book that is a pleasure to read, a tremendous learning experience for Muslims and non-Muslims, Easterners and Westerners, equally. Every home must have a copy !!",1
2900,"Did NOT like this phone: The sound was fine but the red light (signaling that the answering machine was on) was too large and too bright; the neighbors could see that light. There was ONE ring choice, with 4 pitches, but the same annoying ring. I'd try to turn the ringer volume down and accidentally mute it altogether. And the LED was unreadable from a seated position. Really, just an awful phone. I tried AT&T models 1856 and 1855 and they were virtually identical in their pros (sound quality) and cons (features, annoying light, bad ringer, very bad LED).",0

In the garage the stand rolls well, but it is tipsy on the one wheel end. Just something for you to note. I thought that the whole thing was going to fly over one day when I was moving it quickly out of the way to get to my router table. Lesson learned - be deliberate and you will be fine. The wheels are also on the smaller end so getting it back into the garage requires lifting the wheels over the 3/4 inch drop. Other than that it is exactly what I needed to save my back.

Will Farrell was more annoying, unfunny and awkward than ever throughout the whole thing. I don't know who keeps casting this guy. (-2 Stars) Nicole Kidman really did what she could to try saving this thing.(2 Stars for Nicole for really looking and playing the part well.)The only highpoints of this debacle where Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine. Two dreadfully underutilized veteran actors in this film who completely steal the show in every scene they are in. (2 Stars for them) Yet for some reason their story didn't even wrap up in the end, unless I missed it because I fell asleep and didn't realize it. That brings the total to 2 stars, but believe me I am really pushing it here.",0

I would not have purchased this item had I known I wouldn't be able to hear it in English or Croatian.",0
2909,"Beautiful Ring!: This is a beautiful ring that is of excellent quality. The only reason I did not give it a complete 5 stars is because I prefer very dark tiger's eye and this stone is very light. However, because the overall quality of the ring is so phenomenal, I am keeping it. It should be noted that the ring sits on the finger at a slant, not upright as in the picture. That is not a problem in appearance, just trying to help with a description. I actually prefer the slanted look for this ring.",1
2910,"I AGREE WITH THE PERSON BELOW: This collection is a travesty indeed. Great poems no doubt, but abysmally read. Furthermore they should have put all the introductions together separate and apart from the poems. It's nice to hear intros the first time around. But who wants to hear the intros everytime you listen to the poems? Sometimes I want to hear just a stream of poetry without any interuptions and this format makes that impossible. It's incredible that such a great concept could be so terribly executed.",0
2911,"Original and far superior Viper: This is the original late 70's series Viper, which I consider to be far superior in looks and interest from the re-make. I had one of these as a kid but did not have the patience to put any real detail into it so when I saw this one I had to get it. I did not pay more than $25 for mine and do not understand why it is now listed at almost $90 when $25- $30 models are still out there at hobby shops. This was a pretty good model, no problems with any of the parts coming together and some decent degree of detail. Would have been nicer if it had come with a lighting set or at least some suggestions on how to light it beings the instructions suggest that you do. Would have given it a 5 if it had included the lights.",1

2914,"A very good read.: The book is well written, very interesting, and easy for a lay person to understand.

2916,"Noble effort, but really nothing new in the genre: I was drawn to this work from a recomendation from George RR Martin, who is my favorite fantasy writer. But, I was bitterly disappointed in this book. The writing is competent, the atmosphere chilly and she tries to build up momentum for the main story, a few subplots, and fills in a backstory. But, very little seems to get accomplished in the first 250 pages. There were no characters that I actually cared about and no sense of wonder at any mystery that made me want to turn the page. By way of contrast, GRRM's works by that point had at least 5 characters that I wanted to learn much more about and had started half a dozen story lines that captured my interest. Bone Doll seems to put almost all its eggs in one basket with its main story, and it's not as interesting as one of the top 3 of GRRM's subplots. A very competent writer, but there are better books.",0
2917,"Harmony in simplicity and scientific accuracy: It may be difficult to write a simple book and even more difficult to write a scientifically correct book. It takes a master, however, to combine simplicity with scientific accuracy, depth and insight in an introductory book. Ken Rothman has accomplished just this with his new textbook.",1
2918,"Mixed feelings: There are some good informations in this book, so I'm not giving it one star, but the recipes aren't appealing at all, and they don't examine every con in a vegan diet, for example they don't consider how unhealthy is soy, how eating seitan can be a problem for celiacs and how it, not milk, brings calcium away from our bones. I've given it away after keeping, but don't using, it for years.",0

However, when I heard ""What Is Love?"" on Fred Schneider's ""Party out of Bounds"" radio show, I decided to take a chance and purchase ""World Clique."" Bad idea. Aside from the aforementioned song and ""Groove is in the Heart"", this album is lame and uninspired, filled with redundant dance rhythms and forgettable melodies. Don't make the same mistake I did; save your money on a record worth listening to. If you like their one-hit-wonder song ""Groove..."", find a compilation album with this song on it.",0

2921,"Sultry bordering on lethargic: I was most impressed, and moved, by Ute Lemper's rendition of Weill pieces, and her 'Berlin Cabaret Songs' album. This collection of songs, many made famous by Marlene Dietrich and Edith Piaf, is a big disappointment. The energy, and gut quality of their original interpreters, are missing here. Every song is played at a tortoise's pace, with strange musical accompaniements, the songs hardly recognizable if you are familiar with the originals. A case, perhaps, of Lemper trying too hard to 'modernize' what should be left alone. The end product is embarrassingly self-conscious and shallow.",0
2922,"Cerwin Vega CVHD 5.1 sub-woofer issues: I purchased Cerwin vega after reading rave reviews at cnet and other sites. I like the sound quality - produces great sound when it works.Noticed an issue with sub-woofer.

So watching a movie, the sub cuts out after 20 mins, then i have to raise the volume for it to start working again.Haven't yet called customer service so can't rate that.",0
2923,"This book is a good read!: The writing is funny and sexy, and the thoughts of the women in the stories are similar to thoughts we have all had. On the one hand, you can relate to them because they are just trying to understand how to be a woman in today's society. But on the other hand, you are thanking God that you are not like them! These stories say what some of us are afraid to say out loud. That we don't know how to act as women. Should we be sexy, career women, moms, smart, ambitious, dumb?? Although the women in this book were bitchy, it was liberating to read about them and seeing how, in the end, they stayed true to themselves. No, it is not a ""deep"" literary work, but it is a good, juicy read that made me think.",1
2924,Unsatisfied customer: The seller contacted me to let me know that she was out of town and that she would not be able to ship the book until the following week but said that she would overnight it and then she emailed me the day before to let me know that she could not find the book and she would have to cancel the order. I needed to start school the following day. I would not recommend to buy anything from this seller. I am extremely disappointed.,0

This dvd captures how great rock n roll wasback then and will never be again. I agree with oneguy about Blackmore's long solo's they do get zzzzzzat times! Dio holds this show together. This is a showjust before Long Live Rock n Roll was released andit's cool they do a different version here! maybe theoriginal version? Anyway you got Bob Daisley on bassand Cozy Powell on drums!

2930,"horrible slant against moms: The slant against stay at home moms in the ""The Mommy Myth was intolerable. The authors celebrate selfishness and use this book it appears, to ease their own guilt. ""The Mommy Myth"" serves that purpose only and is an insult to every woman, career or stay at home, mother or not. There is a definite political (I don't sit home baking cookies) feel to the writing and I get the impression, it is the authors' own inadequacies that make them lash out against what other moms are doing and doing quite well. The message should be different strokes for different folks and that would unite women. Instead, they choose to make stay at home moms look plastic, as if what they are doing is somehow un-natural. Moms actually being the ones doing the mothering seems to tick these two off and it leaves the reader wondering why. ""The Mommy Myth"" is not a book I could ever recommend.",0

Merely stating what foods are beneficial, if you search online for ""super foods"", or any similar theme, you will get more information, more biochemical rationale, in one page than in this entire book.

2940,"Solid!: One of the many issues that comes with learning the Rorschach is interpretation and formulating these hypotheses into language that your patient/non psychology professionals will understand. The Exner books are great for gaining a basic understanding of how to code and score. However, its Weiner that really does a nice job bringing the data together in a meaningful way. Additionally, I enjoy Weiner's writing style- its easy to read and provides many examples to fill out the theoretical points. Lastly, I am a fan of the psychodynamic approach he takes, but, at times, I think he reaches a bit far with his interpretations. All in all its a very helpful reference. I would also recommend Weiner and Greene's The Handbook of Personality Assessment- it presents a range of instruments from self report to projective.",1

2949,"what!? you don't have this?: Where to begin...Chum is by far the best band to ever come out of west virginia, and probably one of the best metal bands i have ever heard (besides TOOL). They have captured one of the lowest growls ever imagined and blended it with the sickest groove i have heard to date. Live is even better but after Jan. 18th '02, you probably won't see them live anymore so buy this cd, before all of them are gone. You can't find it in any store in Huntington, and that's where they're from. ...",1
2950,"welcome to the Rumpus Room...: Take a ride up the elevator and a trip back in time to party at the Rumpus Room with Hugh, the playmates, and hip guests including Lenny Bruce, Ella Fitzgerald, Linda Ronstadt, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joe Cocker, and LeRoy Neiman. The booze was flowin' and the cigarettes were smokin' during this late-night variety/talk show/dance party that was on the cutting edge at the time, and still seems fresh and a little subversive today. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore, folks... and that's a damn shame. Please keep 'em coming, Hef! (Definitely skip the insufferable interview ""bonus feature,"" though...)",1
2951,"good for indoor ""camping"": I got this for my 13 year old son for an overnight with friends. I'm not sure it would be warm enough for real camping but it was perfect for the place they stayed. He had some trouble getting it rolled back up and we couldn't get it zipped back in the bag no matter what we tried, but it does have a nice strap to hold it rolled up if you can't get it back in the bag",1
2952,"Not as good as the cover promises!: I have read through the book and I should say this book is like other last-minute-published ones, filled with numerous typos, especially in the code, (in snippets and the final project). The typos and lost parts make it a real challenge to learn ASP.Net using the book and impossible to do it in 21 days.If I remember correctly, this line of TY in 21 days, are supposed to help people learn new stuff in a short time, while in here we have a book which makes you wonder how to solve the writers mistakes and get the code working!!!",0
2953,"A good caddie but a bad writter...: Michael Carrick is certainly a good caddie, but not a good writter. What makes him great as a caddie (calmness, keeping quiet, beeing 100% behind his player, Tom Kite), makes his book boring. No spicy details about the life on tour here. It is very obvious that Carrick did not want to upset anyone, starting from his boss, and the result is pretty boring reading. No funny anecdotes, no peek at what happens behind close doors... This is a book aimed at no one, I agree with the previous reviewer. Seasoned golfers won't get much help from Carrick's tips, they sound like 10 steps to break a 100. And if you are a beginer, my guess is that you will want to learn from a pro, not a caddie (try ""The element of Scoring, by Ray Floyd, to improve your game)",0
2954,"Worst game: This game was a let down. At first it was kinda cool, because of the characters I remembered as a child. But after 30 minutes that wore off, and it wasn't even close to BF1942. They did nothing to expand on the gameplay.The weapons have no feel of power, just blah... I didn't have high hopes, I was expecting a game to be at least as good as BF1942 or Call of Duty, but it didn't come close.",0
2955,"A book as steamy as it's locale.......: This book was terrific, Ms. Cameron's best to date. Not only was the romance hot and fast but the mystery plot had enough twists and angles to satisfy most any reader.

2957,"I give this book zero stars.: This is a book that discourages emotional connection between parent and child and rather looks at the parent-child relationship entirely through the paradigm of control. The methods presented for gaining such control are harsh at best and more often, abusive and deeply damaging to human development.",0

2960,"Great solution for the pantry!: Coming back to buy a second rack for the pantry we liked the first so much. Very nice construction and holds a good amount of cans. Love that its adjustable so I can customize the cans I want to put on each level. A few tips if you're thinking of buying one: 1) if you have wire shelving, prepare to put something underneath it to make it more stable (we have a heavy piece of cardboard under ours), 2) Make sure your shelf has the proper support, this thing gets heavy when fully loaded! Overall, very happy with this purchase! I know a lot of people were concerned about size: Our wire pantry shelving is 18"" deep and there is 16"" between our shelves and this rack fit perfectly. Fits more cans than I expected!",1
2961,"LOVE!: I love moody boys singing, and that is exactly what this CD is. Interpol has a very 80's retro sounds, but they don't get bogged down in it, like some of the other current, retro bands. Plus, I think all these songs are incredibly sexy. I don't give it 5 stars becuase as much as I love it, most all the songs sound very similar, there's not a lot of variety here. But the one note this CD hits, is a great one!",1

2967,"Thrilling: BLOW OUT director Brian DePalma could probably make an exciting film in his sleep, not that he was dozing here. The best DePalma film I have seen, BLOW OUT includes cinematic poetry in addition to the director's usual suspense and action elements. Another big plus: John Lithgow, whose antagonist role proves as wicked as any I have seen. The director's affection for female nudity, even when the subject is actress-wife Nancy Allen, perplexes me. But all the great artists confound even their fans. In 1981 I saw BLOW OUT three or four times at the movies. See BLOW OUT, a work of thrilling art from the artist Brian DePalma, today.",1
2968,"TONS of mistakes, typos, incorrect formulas in EVERY chapter!: This is an AWFUL textbook. One person in our class has the 2nd edition, and it doesn't have any of these mistakes! The THIRD edition is a piece of GARBAGE! It was so difficult trying to comprehend complex formulas when the examples given arent even correct! Wrong values, wrong, math, wrong symbols, mislabeling...and we're only to chapter 30 so far.Simple things are OVER covered to the point of exhaustion, but when the chapter on filters came up, there was nothing to give examples of how to figure out how to do the problems at the end of the chapter. Power factor correction is barely glanced upon, and the author gives complex formulas when basic Ohms law could be used instead.If you use the 3rd edition in your classroom, PLEASE verify with your instructor so you dont struggle with the homework for no reason",0
2969,Cryptonomicon or a lesson in tedium: I found this book to be tedious in the extreme.It is way too wordy and is very disjointed.I am an avid reader but the only thing I could look forward to with this book was finishing it so I could finally put the darn thing away!,0
2970,"You're in for a long read.: Since I am seriously considering becoming an English teacher, I decided that I should get a head start on things and read as many classics as I possibly could last summer. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" happened to be the most difficult one to get through. The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity.",0
2971,"Nice But Not As Expected: These baked custard cups , in the classic ribbed design and size we all know and love from Grandma's day, also make delicious high and light popovers.

2973,"Wordy, rambling: Waters packs his songs full of ""too many"" words. His themes are compelling, but he could have been better served editing his material by half. What he sings is almost unlistenable, like a combination of Bob Dylan and Mark Knopfler. Arrangements and mix and instrumentation are good, particularly the guitar work of Jeff Beck. I came away disappointed. THe brief instrumental ""Ballad of Bill Hubbard"", all by itself, said what Waters wanted to say with the entire album.",0
2974,"Terrible Zippers: This bag had all the features that i was looking for. insulated bottle holder, side pocket big enough for a sippy cup, place for my wallet, keys and cell phone, convenient place for diapers and wipes (easily accessible). This bag was perfect except for the defective zippers. They get stuck and that is really annoying when you are trying to change a baby or do whatever else with one hand and the baby in the other. My grandmother suggested rubbing candle wax on them so that they will slide easier, i tried this trick and they still got stuck so i bought a new bag.",0

However, I didnt even finish this game, since it got so boring and repetitive. It had great potential, but every misson feels the same, and they all are. They are all basically ""go to point a and destroy those robots"". And after you destroy those robots in point A, it makes you go to point B,and over again. You can fight villans though. If you are a hardcore fan of Superman comics and stuff, you may enjoy this. But I can say that I didnt. It could have been so good too. Its the most authentic Superman game i've ever played, and probably the best one ever. Thats not saying very much though, considering Superman's dark videogame history...",0

2981,"Not a criticism, just an observation: Although many of the sentiments and promises in this book are sweet and important and wonderful, there are comments in this book that alienate the mixed faith family. I realize that this book was written for the Christian family, but not one of the reviews even mentions how explicitly Christian it is. In my view that is an oversight, this is a book that has two equally strong themes, the promises a Daddy makes and the promises that Christians believe Jesus made. It will be a wonderful fit for many home libraries, but not ours.",0
2982,"Enjoy this effort: Don't worry about Blackmore ""pouting"" or be bothered that he enters the stage two minutes into the opening song. Just enjoy this fine effort by the band at a low point in their creative career. The band still kicks major...and Blackmore is in fine form, his playing is not at all sloppy. I don't know where some reviewers get that. Blackmore is Blackmore and some people think he plays sloppy (some people say Jimmy Page plays sloppy, or Hendrix did)but seeing and hearing him is incredible. The fact that he pitches a small fit on stage and soon left the band makes this release all the more special. Buy this with the confidence that if you like DP you'll enjoy this. Sound and picture are very good, and interviews are a nice extra.",1

2984,This is a great book!!: I would highly recommend this book. It is absolutely such a sweet story-I could hardly put it down as I enjoyed reading about the lives of the various women in this book. It makes you think about your own ancestry and what we might have in common with our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. It has great Christian themes-but is not too overbearing in that sense.,1

There was a magic surrounding the creation of this piece of artistry that can only be marveled at.

2994,"Last Days of What??: Besides being a bit short for a novel, The Last Days of Publishing seems to be missing so many things that could have made for an interesting and readable novel. I have to agree with one of the other reviews, few of the characters are well developed and they seem to come and go, often with minimal explanation. The plot is also weak and presented in out of chronological order, which makes for anticlimactic reading. Much of the information about publishing could easily be gleaned in various magazines and better written books, such as Betsy Lerner's ""The Forest for the Trees"" as well as the nostalgia for the 60's, like many of Tim O'Brien's novels, especially ""July, July"" (which isn't even his best novel). Aside from a clever cover, I can't recommend this book.",0
2995,"More Adventurous Rilo Kiley: Quite frankly, this album is not good... or even fair for that matter. It is extremely bland and tasteless. I am actually quite fond of this genre of music, if it is done right. This one just does not tip the iceberg, so to speak. It is boring, and the musical content does not sound like it was recorded by professional musicians. On this album, ""More Adventurous"" the music is as creative as a W2 form. I absolutly applaude any human being that claims to have an ear for good music that can find the courage and will power to subject their ear drums to such brutal and grotesque defilement. This album is certainly one for the brave.",0
2996,"Doc Ford is better off in Florida: I generally enjoy reading Randy Wayne White novels, and regard him as a good writer. This, the fifth of the Doc Ford series, comes as quite a shock. It is not only boring, boring, it is utter drivel. Here White seems to have changed his style, his informative passages feel out of place and strained, as indeed is most of the book.Doc Ford is changed, Tomlinson is changed. They come over far more believable and better when in Florida, not in Cuba where this novel is set for the most part.Sanibel Flats is also a Doc Ford novel set out of Florida. I didn't enjoy that one either, but it's not drivel.I think White, in North of Havana, has attempted to elevate his writing onto a higher plain and achieved the opposite.",0

2999,"Jeremy Sisto Given Wonderful Opportunity To Make Fool Of Himself: I really like Jeremy Sisto as one of the detectives on this show. He formerly played Billy on 6 FEET UNDER and had a fans from there he's carried to this show. This episode gives him the star turn this time of making a prime jackass out of himself over the female star witness in a case he is working. Even worse, as the case goes forward, it begins to seem that she is less a witness and more a suspect. The expression ""sweating bullets"" could have been coined for him for this episode. I really enjoyed seeing Sisto get a meatier role this time out. I hope the show does it again.",1
3000,"Disney's best direct-to-video sequel: It's an almost impossible task to equal the artistic quality and the success achieved by The Lion King (still the top grossing animated feature ever), so it's not really fair to compare this direct-to-video sequel to the original.However, as far as these productions go, I can't find another of the d-t-v sequels that stands up to this one. The quality of the animation is quite excellent; the story, although very predictable (and very Disney!) is quite competent; the voice talent is also quite good -- they even managed to bring back some of the original players (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella rule!) and included some new ones that match perfectly with their characters (Neve Campbell as Kiara, Andy Dick and others).All in all, this is quite a good flick.",1
3001,"MELT!: This is an excellent movie. Don't watch it if you want character development, a plot with a beginning a middle and end, or any of those other things that genre and art movies don't really require. In place of those things it does have: A techno soundtrack that sounds like it was either lifted from an exercise video or a porno, people dying (melting!) in various ways, and a wonderfully dark sense of humor and strangely charming actors.",1

Each poem ,told from a child's point of view, captures your attention and wonder, as though you were there, experiencing your childhood all over again!

3006,Lots of talent: This young artist is brilliant. I first heard/saw him when I attended one of many of Clay Aiken's concerts.

I could barely move and after I used this I could actually turn my neck from side to side. I used the heating element and it felt great. I didn't think it was too heavy at all; especially once you are using it. Since I am a mother of 2 I don't really have time to go to a massage therapist when I have a crick in my neck, this device makes for a great alternative.If you don't pull your hair up it can get caught up in the massager.I'm happy I tried it.",1

It was not that useful in helping me understand German grammar and sentence structure at a college level. I gave it 4 stars, not because it helped me in my German class, but because I think it is a good down-and-dirty book for learning the language and customs if you will only be spending a short time in Germany. This book might also by good as a refresher for people who have already taken a German class but forgot most of what they learned.",1

3013,"Krups XP4030 Pump Espresso Machine, Black: I ordered the Krups Xp4030 Pump Espresso Machine because I had owned a Krups espresso machine in an earlier model. I was basing my purchase on a belief that the new model would be even better than the first one, but NO, it is not. The first machine was made in Switzerland and the current one I purchased was from China. I don't know if it was the materials used to manufacture the latest, but it was not acceptable. There was definitely a smell of plastic from the machine and then when I foamed the milk, there was a smell of plastic and the taste of rubber. My husband called Krups and they sent a new foaming nozzle, but this was not any better. I returned the machine today. I read that some folks think their machine is great, but I did not have this experience. I wanted badly for this to work and used it for about a month, but I just was not enjoying the coffee every morning.",0

3017,"NOT A JUDGMENT OF QUALITY: Certainly my rating should not be taken as any sort of objective judgment of the quality of this work. It only reflects my impatience with the kind of work that reflects upon reflections upon memories that are reflections of limited evidence, and so on and so forth. What I had hoped for was a light entertainment in which a discovered fact led to something more than an infidelity in a distant past and a trouble-making raking over of dead coals. Not, as they say, my cup of tea. My fault, I failed adequately to find out beforehand what I was getting into. Can't remember just why it happened.",0
3018,Not Recommended: I put this mobile base on my bandsaw. The bandsaw is about 200 lbs. and this already seems too heavy for the base that is rated at 400 lbs.

3021,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is King.: What a hyped cd this is. The genre of guitar, organ, drum trios is filled with dozens of better cds than this. My particular beef is Pat Martino's habit of playing a riff line again and again in the middle of every solo until he's totally destroyed any kind of continuity with what his solo started out to be. What happens..does he run out of ideas?....does he think this is a crowd pleaser?...is he trying to wake up Billy Hart (I don't think so!)This is the slow triumph of the mediocre over the real thing. Instead try any of the 1/2 dozen or so cds with Jimmy Smith and Kenny Burrell.",0

3023,"Good dimming range, annoying noise: I have recently bought this brand of bulb and two others. These ULA bulbs are probably the best for dimming smoothly over a wide range from bright to dim, although they still won't go as low as incandescents. Unfortunately, I can't use them in most rooms because of the noise they create. It is audible even at full power, and gets louder as the bulbs are dimmed. If you have a room where there is background noise all the time, these will be okay, but my house isn't like that.The other brands? GE was much quieter, but had a very limited dimming range. Sylvania was the best compromise for me - much quieter than ULA and much better dimming than GE.",0

But it doesn't, now the Hell...: So I am writing this as I wait, 20 min so far, still on hold after navigating the maze to live rep somewhere on planet earth. The machine came, the beater bar worked for about 20 sec then dead. I have bought all my Apple Computers refurbished, 6 to date, never a problem. This is the first Amazon refurb I bought, BIG MISTAKE!!!!. Apparently from the other reviews, it's a crap shoot if you get a good one, well we pulled snake eyes. I could have driven to Costco and back in the time I have been on hold for both Dyson and now Amazon. Speaking of Costco they have the Animal, wheel model not ball for only 350, as soon as this is finally done I am going there and get one there. WTF? Do they even repair these things? All I can do is share my experiences, all BAD. Do not buy one of these.",0
3025,"Useless: I agree with other reviewers, folds in the felt never straighten out. The felt make it impossible to adjust the alignment of pieces without them pulling apart.

A similar product made with a smooth plastic or silicone would be better for those who need to roll it up thier puzzles.",0
3026,"DELLA is Delightful!: What a fascinating and refreshing character! Della is a delicious blend of sophistication and vulnerability. She is so incredibly real that the reader can't help but embrace her and cheer her on through her struggles. I gloried in her successes and suffered through her failures. Glitzy and glamourous to be sure, but this novel also has the warmth and humanity that sets it a cut above. Encore! Encore!",1

3031,"a good history of the 1840s in Europe: ""In the Beginning"" by Jerome Blum is the history of a pivotal decade in European history, but one that is frequently misunderstood or misinterpreted. I agree with Mr. Walker's review--that this book can be quite dry in parts, but that throughout are little bits that bring the happenings of the period to mind in a new interpretation. I found this book to be interesting, a bit innovative in its analysis, and well written. My only complaint would be that, as usual for history books about this period, it focuses on Britain, France, Russia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with only passing mention of happenings in the other countries of Europe. However, I still found this book well worth the time.",1
3032,"LOVE this cookbook! Great old-fashioned recipes: Great cook book. A lot of great, tried and true recipes, like the standard Chocolate Chip Cookie and Peanut Butter Cookie. Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's.",1

And there's not a lot of cards falling out all over the place like a lot of other publications.Now, the content I find to be quite timely and interesting, even if it doesn't pertain to my situation. I often find articles that might help others out and suggest them to that person. If you are at a crossroads in your life between working and retiring, this is the magazine for you. It's written for people who are retired. Not going to retire, but already retired. Always good topics on managing your finances to health to investing and even on retirement living.

The one problem that I've had with it is sometimes the shutter don't open fully, otherwise it works great and takes awesome pictures.",1
3048,"Who Stole the Funk?: ""Chaos and Disorder"" is the final album Prince recorded for Warner Bros, and it sounds less like an album than an effort to satisfy a recording contract that apparently ended acrimoniously. The CD sounds unfinished, unfocused, and without direction, filled with several tunes that lack the hooks and passion we've come to expect from Prince. ""Dinner With Delores"" passes along nicely, but elsewhere, it's a nosedive. Half-hearted rock and funk stompers abound; the lamest of which is ""I Rock Therefore I Am."" However lackluster ""Chaos and Disorder"" sounds, it never approaches disaster. Still, the music represents a pale version of the former Prince who churned out classics like ""Dirty Mind"" and ""Sign O the Times."" A lot of chaos, and much disorder.",0
3049,It is what it is: This is a great reference book. A good read for those seeking trivia. Glad I have it.,1
3050,"Not for beginners or those needing practical instruction.: I guess I should have read the other two reviews for this book before purchasing. The text doesn't provide enough detail for a novice woodworker or particularly for someone attempting their first instrument to get started. In particular the instrument list should be modified. Simply stating that it includes plans for a lute is misleading when the lute in question is a very Early Medieval type with a skin soundboard. It is more akin to a primitive banjo than what I was looking for. Also, all the drawings are reproduced at such a small scale to be virtually useless and none contain details such as full scale bridge designs or instructions on how to generate one's own patterns. The only useful content in the work is the chapter detailing his method of fretting. It should prove quite useful Caveat emptor!",0
3051,"Very disappointing: I was very sad after reading 1/2 of this book (i could not even finish it). Based on the almost 5 star rating i was excited to start reading it....but was quickly let down. The book is was what I would like to call ""the hot mess express"". I was all over the place, involving you in one scene and then quickly changing into another that had no relevance to the one before. By the time I was able to figure out what the scene was about the reading once again changed in the same pattern as before. The transition/flow of the book was awful. The scenes in the book were also a let down and not well thought out. I am truly saddened by the fact that i wasted ~7 dollars and hours of my time and i would like a credit please...",0
3052,"Amazon oversold this one!: With a 5-year-old grandson in New York, I was interested in the nanny scene and, on impulse, ordered this book from Amazon.

3053,"Windows 2000 is best?: Lots of people have been saying that Windows 2k is not worth the hassle of buying. But I have found this OS extremely useful to business people.

I would suggest going with Windows 2K, as I have found all the new installiation settings more helpful!",1
3054,"Outstanding - Passion meets Precision: The second great version of King Crimson. They came out of the box strong here, all members contributing brilliantly in some relatively equivalent proportion. Robert Fripp has characterized his intention on some of the pieces as wanting to combine the passion you hear in African-American music and in Jimi Hendrix with aspects of the European tradition (precision and symmetry in composition) ala Stravinsky - he and the band actually did that here. Music doesn't get much better than this.Larks' Tongue 1 & 2, and Easy Money, fit the bill I've just described. They are crafted, played, and recorded brilliantly. ""Talking Drum"" is an effective jam, a study in rhythm and dissonance. ""Book of Saturdays"" and ""Exiles"" are vocal ballads - I can actually live without them. But that doesn't diminish the album, which is a real undereheard classic.",1
3055,"This jump rope is great: I love this jump rope! It wasn't too expensive and it is very durable. I don't recommend using it outdoors on concrete, due to it being plastic. It can take the beating though. Im 5ft 8 so its long enough for me and I skip over the rope with ease. I don't have any thing negative to say. I use it 3 times a week and it is holding up quite well.

This They Might Be Giants sing very, very loudly and infuse their songs with new emotion and new life. Which of course is all the more reason to buy this.If you are just getting into TMBG this is an ideal album for you. If you're a dedicated TMBG fan, you should have bought this album years ago.",1

Other first ladies were equally courageous and interesting.",1

Even so this is a horrid book.When I purchase a mystery novel, I expect a puzzle and procedural, not this tiresome diatribe on love and lust, Amor and Eros and other twaddle. It is impossible to concentrate on the crime, for all the boring, repetative nonsense about the lead detective Det. Superintendant Harriet Martens love troubles.

Dan Brown wants to impress you with some zany controversial facts, but he cuts corners by writing a lame unconvincing ""thriller"" around them. Like, I don't understand why Sophie would be so upset at her grandfather that she wouldn't speak to him for 10 years. What she saw wasn't even that big of a deal! That just doesn't make sense. But of course, Mr. Brown wants you to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at the Biblical ""facts."" I think that the story itself is incredibly lame, do Langdon and Sophie really have to spark a romance at the end?! Why?! Gimme a break! I'm insulted. He should've just started a conspiracy website and loaded his facts there instead of wasting perfectly good trees on this stinker!",0

The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.,1
3074,"Spencer film mainly for family-oriented interest.: Bud Spencer would seem a natural to play the genie, and the film is pleasant enough, with one or two of the signature fight scenes Spencer is famous for, but fans will find the film quite lacking in Bud's usual style of humor and toughness.

For the real classics from Bud Spencer, check out ""Crime Busters,"" ""Go For It,"" and ""Odds and Evens!""",0

It's a little emo, a little grind, a little drone, a little jazz...and no it's still not interesting. It's just a mess, and almost like an entire album of one big jam session gone horribly wrong. I hate bands that just throw together as many different music styles as they possibly can without any regard to songwriting and call it good. I'm sure all the band members, their label, and their clueless fans think they're genius, and that's a real shame.The guys from Maudlin of the Well who are now in this band really should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such crap.",0

Well, I guess I did want to jump out of my seat... and go see another movie! It starts off slow and unfortunately that is the way it ends. It is filmed like a documentary, but I have seen scarier things watching the Discovery Channel. And compared to Jaws...pulleeezz, this movie does not compare. The only thing that was really scary was the acting. The reviewers who gave this movie high ratings may have been distracted by the full frontal nudity in the first 10 minutes, and like the woman in this film I also wished for death by the end.",0
3078,The 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection is a better choice.: I don't really disagree with the other reviewers' evaluation of Piaf. She is truly one of the great artists of the 20th Century. I got this set; and then I got the 10 CD 30th Anniversary Collection. This 2 CD set has only a few songs recorded in the late 50's and early 60's when recording technology could do justice to her voice. The 10 CD set has several CD's recorded toward the end of her career. The recorded sound is outstanding; and Piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end. I know the 10 CD is expensive; but I prefer it above anything else I have by Piaf.,0

Tim Daly is awesome as Superman. Like Conroy, he has an excellent Superman voice; but, in a different way.The animated series of Batman & Superman were well written, well voiced, & were drawn very well.Filled with features, unlike the live action DVDs, The batman/Superman DVD is sure to be among the best ever animated DVDs. The major drawback, however, is, there is always so much more they could have done. It seems as if ALL the DVDs have the same extras. Some interviews with the actors, and some deleted scenes and other behind the scenes clips is always awesome.I give this a 41/2 out of 5 stars. Or, 95 of 100.",1

The only problem is they don't make it anymore as far as I can tell and my current one has a nick in the screen that scratches my face. So I tried this bump free Wahl. It basically did not do as advertised. It was supposed to trim the whiskers above the surface so that they don't curl back in under the skin like lift and cut or close shave razors do. This Wahl basically took off a top layer of skin and lifted pulled and chewed out most of my whiskers while just laying some down without cutting them at all.I've decided to go to the disposable type black men's bump control razor I can get at Walmart. While it takes me a little longer to shave than electric, it is doing the type of job my old Remington did.Hope this helps. If you want bump control for curly facial hair, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!",0

I hadn't realized what a troubled place pre-Protestant Revolution England was and I truly want to keep reading way past my bedtime. My only problem was the romance. It seemed rather dry to me.

Between the Native American legends, multiple flashbacks, information inconsistencies and extremely fortutious coincidences, the story is hard to follow. I reached page 100 and realized that I didn't care about any of the chacters, perhaps because they didn't come across as real people. Also the blood and gore seemed gratitutious -oh, here is a chance to show what a bad guy the killer is- rather than adding to a scarey atmosphere. Also, I'm tired of authors doing the Indian is a mystic power who communicates with the other world, so all the one character has to do is touch the book and he knows bad things are going to happen. It just came across as false and cliche. I love J.J. Jance's other books. I hope she goes back to writing those kind of books - page-turning thrilling plots, and real characters.",0

Sound quality is good, especially for independent recordings from the early sixties.The first 2 songs were written by Zappa and performed by Zappa and Ray Collins (who would become part of the Mothers of Invention). The Heartbreakers songs are of unknown origin. These songs are typical early sixties, doo-wap rock songs. Think along the lines of Teen Angel.The two Bud Guy songs are Holloween, monster songs. These type of songs were popular in the early sixties, with Monster Mash being the most famous.If you want to get a historic perspective of Zappa, then you might enjoy this. There is some clumsy avant garde guitar work that is a sign of what is to come. I think the spot on the Tonight Show with Steve Allen where Zappa plays a bicycle tire is more interesting.",0

About 30 mins. into the movie the picture started distorting, and after that it would skip large chunks of the movie. There was nothing visibly wrong with the DVD itself. But, I saw enough. Even before I reached the defective part, it was like watching a foreign film without subtitles. I had almost no clue what was going on, and didn't really care after a while.

Even though I came to hate Elwood, that very feeling convinced me that this was a gifted writer. I do hope that O'Connor continues in what appears to be his chosen field. But would I recommend this book to others? Not a chance.",0

While printing a letter the print cartrige went all the way to the right (under that ledge) and cannot be moved no matter what we do. We call support, to find out what we can do to make it slide back to the middle but that thing is stuck and would not move. Finally, I was told that we need to purchase a new carriage assembly (whatever that is). We wanted to find out if we could just bring it to the 'Geek Squad' and have them fix it well, I was told that this is something that happen every so often with Kodak printers it's a defect. Go figure, this defect had to happen as soon as my warranty expires. I would not feel comfortable recommending this printer to anyone.",0
3168,the temptress is not as tempting as the first sorceress: this movie has its good points for example it has julie strain returning in the sequeal it also features julie k smith as a witch in the coven however the story line is a bit far fetched the first movie was far better and featured linda blair sorceress 2 also has to rely on sex to pull it through which isn't bad however anyone who rents sorcoress 2 will be upset that they just did not buy a skin flick it would have least not led you to believe that there was supposed to be a story there.,0

3181,"You won't get it the first time: Obviously, fans of previous OLP albums are put off by the updated sound. I had always liked there radio songs but never was inspired to buy the albums. I bought this disc on a whim and initially hated it. Gravity is not a simple pop disc that you get into the first time. The vocals and lyrics become more powerful with each spin.

3182,"lingering: I read this book a year ago in bits and pieces while travelling, and I continue to think about it every now and then. This may be the best way to read it; not quite a story with a chronological narrative, the book consists of short sections that trace Lady Sarashina's inner world throughout the span of her life, nearly a millenia ago in ancient Heian Japan. I found it somewhat haunting how she appeared to have lived as if separate from the world, while communicating in her writing a deep sensitivity. For me, the feeling of the book has become almost mythicized, though this effect was not immediate. It takes a while to sink in, to realise its beauty, as do the events in ones lives that become more potent in reflection -- as it is this kind of reflection that Lady Sarashina expresses through her writing, which form the book in itself.",1

3186,"Worthwhile and important...: This is an important documentary. Several of the authors interviewed (John Gatto, Henry Giroux, Alfie Kohn, Pat Farenga, etc) really make the film. Underneath the areas examined by the film (psychiatric drugging of children, the repercussions of industrial education, teaching to the tests, conditioning kids to submit to authoritarianism, etc) lies eye-opening support for concepts like critical pedagogy, deschooling, and unschooling. A must-see for parents and teachers alike. Occasionally just a bit dramatic - but nonetheless a very worthwhile documentary. The film won't disappoint. In the same genre is 'Waiting for Superman' and 'Race to Nowhere'. Overall 'The War on Kids' is an excellent introduction into examining why we should look hard at how we are treating our children.",1

I remember seeing this in the discount bin and dollar stores for years before I broke down and wasted a dollar on this too late for the hair metal party, wanna be posers.

As such, it's a required accessory if you want to take full advantage of this console.I haven't always been delighted with the multiplayer aspects of the games I've tried so far -- some games won't combine hot-seat and network multiplayer, and game packages aren't always clear about network versus local multiplayer features.

It is 45 pages long - 39 pages devoted to police badges; 6 devoted to police patches!There are no pictures of patches, no prices, no sources - it is clearly not a ""guide"". Two pages are devoted to ""Patch Syles"" with listings such as, ""CIRCLE - This patch is round in shape and also a popular style""....In all fairness, if you are a badge collector, you may find the book a bit more valueable - but just a bit.The Pocket Guide is a glorified pamphlet, hardly worth its... price tag.

I believe the doctor was about 38 years old and Danina was about 18 (?). It's been some time since I've read this book, about a year and a half, so I might be a few years off with the age difference, but I remember it being close to 20 years.

Jessica Stein is a neurotic young woman who can't seem to find a man worth the time to date, so she answers a personals ad placed by another woman. Right off the bat the viewer sees how quirky Jessica really is. She runs out on the first meeting.Without giving too much of the movie away, we see how this relationship finally develops then succumbs to what many couples, both gay and straight ultimately have to face, the loss of compatibility. The movie goes from highs to lows as these characters are developed into living, breathing people. I think it helps that the main actors also wrote the script. Almost anyone with a sense of humor or sense of romance will enjoy this film.",1

Although the see through covers are convenient I hardly ever have them down where I would need to look through the cover in order to see through the scope. I should just buy the solid covers with no option to see through but in the event that a very quick shot needs to be taken I dont have to worry about whether or not the covers are up or down.One word of caution that I have found a little annoying is that the spring clip that is used to retain the lens in the larger sizes, such as the size that would fit on a 50mm objective doesn't hold the lens in very well so as you close the cover, often times pushing on the lens, the lens sometimes pop out. I would suggest installing the solid covers on objectives 50mm and larger. This doesn't seem to be an issue on the smaller sizes.The size 4 fits on the front of an aimpoint 9000sc perfectly.",1

Dannah's preachy, holier-than-thou attitude is a tremendous turnoff except to those who are like-minded or being bent under the thumb of fundamentalist Christianty and Puritanism, which seems evident from the kidns of people who have been giving this monstrocity of a book 5 stars. The delights of sexual experience were given to us to enjoy, not to keep under lock and key for one guy who may or may not be good in bed or even worth staying in a marriage with. In addition, science has given us contraception, which allows women to choose how many children they have. This book undoes every last shred of the women's rights movement. I am not a promoter of promiscuity, but this book's only message is that we should feel guilty and dirty for even thinking of sex outside of marriage. It's books like this that remind me why I gave up Christianty many years ago.",0

I'm not sure that was Koontz's intention, but for me, Fric was the protagonist. The villain, Corey, is second. The Face himself is, for me, very underdeveloped. Perhaps that was intentional, but I don't think so.",1

3227,"Thin, weakly pigmented -- not finger paint!: Finger paint is supposed to be thick and gloppy -- that's what makes it so satisfying to smoosh around on the paper. It's also supposed to be richly pigmented and glossy, thereby providing a fun visual and tactile experience. This 'finger paint' is thin -- more the consistency of poster paint, and the color is weak. As soon as my children spread the paint around on the paper the color all but disappeared. We were left with a watery mess with the barest hint of green. What a disappointment! I have written to the company and am waiting a response. Meanwhile, I've ordered a different brand of finger paint.

So I am one of those people who thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was extremely well done, and I wasn't familar with the story before seeing the movie. I did notice that when watching the play after watching the movie, there were characters I was only vaguely familiar with, but still, I consider it a movie well worth watching.

3236,"Not one of Thompson's best...: Usually I like Thompson's stuff, but this book left me wanting. I couldn't help the overall feeling that the heroine just wasn't good enough for the hero. I still felt that way at the end of the book as well. There was just too deep a chasm between the two. He was patient, mature, responsible and understanding. Though he wasn't the most intuitive, he was sensitive. She, however, was stubborn, self-absorbed and had a ridiculously awful habit of not listening. She literally steamrolled right over-top of him trying to talk many times in the book. It was much like an adult man dating a needy teenage girl. I was underwhelmed overall.",0
3237,"Hardly a worthy tribute!: This disc is a disaster. Considering the vast number of wonderful Beach Boys tunes, the song selection for this tribute is stunningly unoriginal. It is merely a handful of Beach Boy hits, performed poorly.The only reason to buy this travesty is for the ""bonus tracks"" from Al & Matt Jardine (a solid reworking of Garth Brooks' PAPA LOVED MAMA) and Mike Love (a faithful cover of Springsteen's HUNGRY HEART).",0
3238,"Another not very good sheena album: 'Madness, Money, and Music' is one of my favourite albums, but Sheena's career went downhill from there (with a few blips of which 'No sound but a heart' was definitely one).This album is definitely not as bad as 'Do you', but it's not much better. 'Fire and Rain' is by far the best track, showcasing Sheena's beautiful voice. But it was never the voice that was the problem, it was the choice of material and here that choice is just not very good",0

3240,"Disappointing book, disappointing author: I was disappointed in this book for essentially the same reasons as Stephen Ferg (see his review dated Dec. 19/2001). I find that the book does not do justice to the 'Patterns' buzzword.I suggest you read Stephen's review before you buy this book. I will not rewrite the same comments here. The reason I am writing this review is to say that I find unacceptable that the author would review his own book here, not clearly identify himself as the author, give it 5 stars, and be so vain in his review. I believe in modesty and letting the readers decide for themselves (isn't this what Amazon's review system is for?) as opposed to what the author has done here. Also, as of this writing there is only one person who voted Stephen's review to be 'not helpful' -- and I would not be surprised in the least if it was the author himself put in that vote..!",0

You would think that it would be suitable for listening to Audible Books. BEWARE! I used it in my car and stopped and started the player as I ran errands. Most of the time when restarted it jumped ahead about 4 minutes and I had to rewind and try to find my place. I contacted SanDisk Support and they told me that it was a ""limitation"" on the player due to buffering. I told them that any consumer would consider it a defect and would never purchase it for this use if they were aware of this ""limitation"". I asked that they provide me a player that was suitable for this use. They never replied to this request. I would avoid SanDisk products as they misrepresented this player and do not stand behind their products.",0

3248,Too Leaky: I was experimenting with different bottle options for my son. I had several platex bottles with liners and was looking for a more economical choice. I was hoping to find a good bottle that did not require a liner. I purchased a package of avent bottles and was happy for the first few days. On the fourth day the bottle began leaking horribly. By the end of the week 2 of the 3 bottles were leaking and the 3rd began to leak the next week. I followed all cleaning instructions. The bottles were never put in the microwave or dishwasher. I do not recommend this bottle. They are too expensive for the quality.,0
3249,"DROOOOONNNNNEEEEE.: I can't get enough of this band. Ever since I heard of them through The Black Keys' website, I've been digging them like crazy. The Black Angels are a 6-piece psychedelic drone rock band from Austin, TX. Now when I say drone rock, I don't mean stuff like Sunn O))) and Earth, I mean more of the mid 60's swirly sound of The Rolling Stones, along with the jagged punk of The Velvet Underground. Songs such as Empire, Manipulation, and Black Grease have a long drone underneath it all, combined with excellent guitar playing, and a singer that brings Jim Morrison back from the dead. Listen to Better Off Alone and tell me it doesn't sound like The Doors. There is also a feeling of urgency in the music, with a anti-war message on songs like Young Men Dead, The First Vietnam War, and Sniper At The Gates Of Heaven. Blues starts to incorporate into the later tracks, and you're left with an incredible debut that never gets old. I look forward to hearing more from this great band.",1

It has nothing to do with the first two despite the appearance of Atreyu (who in this incarnation is played by Jason James Richter - i guess the money was too low for someone the caliber of jonathan brandis) i digress. even the creatures are cheesy. there is no spark of imagination like the first two in the way the creatures act or talk much of it relies only on pathetic one liners. the plot is also sad. like i said, the only reason to watch this is to see jack black, one of the finest comedians of our time. thanks for your time.",0

I only paid the extra as the disc states 'Running time: 98 minutes' - YEAH? Well there's only a few minutes for the main skit, even my 5-year old said ""that's it?"". Shame on Dreamworks, I will never again fall for this, and will not be so quick to buy any Dreamworks title in the future. For others with the same comment - please write an email to Dreamworks and complain, hopefully they won't do this to their 'fans' again.

I think the reviews here don't represent the true value of this book.In short, this book is a lot of bits and pieces of episodes that do not really lead to any theory or takeaway. I kept hoping til the end that something worth remembering would come up.I would recommend this book to someone fresh out of college who needs basic understanding of corporate politics, but definitely not to any of my friends with work experience (5+ years?).I decided to buy this book because I had not taken any power and influence related courses during my MBA studies in the US. I had kept all the syllabi of all courses offered at my school and I was catching up on some textbook readings for the courses I hadn't taken. This is another reason why I didn't think twice about buying it without reading it.I hope this helps!",0

As one friend put it, the landscape of the novel and its characters evoke a passion and sensibility that can live with you for a long time afterward.",1

But again, in this complication, they are missing a few hits. Will the record company ever get it correct? It's not truly the Ultimate without all of the hits. The songs they are missing are ""A Song For You"",""Goofus"",""I Just Fall In Love Again"",""(Want You) Back In My Life Again"",""Beechwood 45-789"",""Make Believe It's Your First Time"",""Honululu City Lights"",and ""If I Had You"". If these songs were to be included on this Ultimate Collection, then it would be just perfect. Hopefully on the Carpenters 40th anniversary, they will release album with all of these songs on it.

They also give me arch support for my super high arches, which is nice since most flats have none. Because they are 3/4 length, they fit in all the shoes I need them for. You can move them from shoe to shoe. They come with little velcro things to help them stick in place, but you can also just use them without -- they don't really slip. Note that they are a hard plastic, so they are durable but not cushy. This is better for me with my tendonitis, but good to be aware of if you are looking for comfort.",1

Our old kettle has a beautiful song, as the note will slowly rise in volume and pitch until it settles on it's final, unmistakable note at full boil. The whistle on the LeCrueset cannot seem to settle on a single note, it warbles and garbles random pitches and volumes in a very awkward way. Is this what the designers and engineers planned, or did they forget to actually try it? Maybe the sound of the whistle was never a consideration or they got a really good deal on the hardware. Either way, I've heard a lot of tea kettles in my life, and appreciated a good many of them, but this one sounds obnoxious.",0

3270,"Total pile of garbage: Gosh, what hype over a complete pile of garbage. If it was supposed to be ""disturbing and dark,"" the director needs to get over himself. David Lynch films, which are highly criticized at Amazon, are dark and disturbing. This looks like something a hormonal 14 year old would put together. The acting was terrible, except for the one shining moment of Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Evelyn. Oh, and for the comment on those ""people that expected it to be like SCREAM or something""-- I despise Scream and those teeny bopper movies and this movie did NOTHING for me. It seems as if it were some sort of ""message movie"" to warn against the dangers of capitalism. The soundtrack was pretty good, but the problem is the best songs are not on the soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, do not waste your money or time watching this film.",0
3271,"OK to watch, but difficult to follow: When i got this DVD, i sat down and watched the whole thing through, so i'd have an idea of what it's about. The next time I watched it, I was ready to work out. Five minutes into it, I realized that she doesn't do a good job narrating what she's doing, so I had to constantly look at the screen. There's a lot of fancy editing and voice over work, but if they just focused on a basic instructional DVD, this could be much better. And she should really keep the banter to a minimum. If I were to do this 3x a week (which i won't, bec i don't like it), her talk about her mantra or how good she looks in her shorts would drive me nuts.",0

3276,"Extremely pleased!: I was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment, so I did some research and read a lot of reviews about many different vacuums. After much hemming and hawing over which one would suit me, I decided upon this one and I was pleasantly surprised! This vacuum has really nice suction and it doesn't seem to lose that the longer the vacuuming session runs; it also really fluffs up the carpet. I have a dog and she does shed. This vacuum does a really good job at picking up the hair. I have been able to use the pet attachment tool and that works pretty well. Animal hair is stubborn anyway, so I needed a little patience to suck it all up and get those little hairs that were entwined with the fabric fibers. I am glad that I purchased this vacuum. One caution though, when you use the hose, the main agitator still runs. So, be careful what your vacuum is sitting on or you will have a worn spot on your carpet if you let the vacuum sit in one place for too long.",1

Too often, anyone who harbors intellectual doubts or leaves the faith is said to be putting up a ""smoke screen"" to cover some kind of moral failure or rebelliousness. Tucker, however, is exceedingly sympathetic to the doubter and refuses such easy dismissals. Her idea of ""doubting your doubts"" as well as your faith was thought-provoking. However, I would add that I was dismayed by her repeated assertions that she could never leave the faith herself. How could anyone write this book and make such a claim? If there is no possible evidence that would cause one to change their mind, then an honest search seems to be hamstrung at the get-go.",1

It looked great under the Christmas tree, but that was about where the magic w/ this item ended.First of all, the picture is good, considering it's a pink kiddy TV.The DVD player broke about 2 wks after we first started using it. It was past the 30-day return though because I'd bought it in early Dec to be given as a gift.The seller was NOT accommodating at all. I'd love to post the name of the seller here, but I'm sure it wouldn't get published. I'll gladly pass on the name to anyone who asks for it though.The seller was willing to fix this product if I returned it AT MY EXPENSE (which was going to be $50+ due to the weight of the product) and then I'd have to pay for return shipping back to me! - I was not willing to spend another $100 on this junk TV that broke after 2 weeks of use.So, I strongly recommend not purchasing this product and to do your research before purchasing from a seller on here.",0

3306,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME: As a military wife of 10 years, I was intrigued to read a book about other military wives and their perspective on military life. What a joke! This is a poorly written book in which the reader has to slog through 3/4 of the book in order to finally read about life in the military. And throughout the whole book there are the most outrageous typos and other editorial errors. Who was her editor? As a military spouse I could not relate at all to either of her charaters. The words and actions of Ms. Gaines's characters did nothing to help diffuse the common public misnomer that military personnel are the low class side of our society. I am embarrased by how military spouses are inacurately portrayed in this book. What a waste of time.",0
3307,About the series itself: I never much watched ALF back in the 80's and early 90's when it was on primetime. But I have grown fond of it in syndication. To me the show is great because it goes down so easy. I like Anne Schedeen's characters of Mrs. Tanner as she acts upset a lot at the alien's antics which provides some conflict in the scripts. And she looks nice in a towel too.,1

3309,"Action: OK, Politics: Lousy: Mr. Clancy changed genres from technical/military to political thriller a couple of books ago. As a result his political thriller contains lots of - semi - military jargon and action. It must be said this side of the book is OK (not splendid as the ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"" or ""Red October"", but OK). However, the political part of this 1080 page book is unfortunately not op to standards: the issues have not been thought through enough to be convincing. And though some solutions could be tempting (some problems are irresolvable if all issues are taken into account), most are a mere waste of time.Another problem I have with this series is the decline in the language quality (techno talk and an overdoses abbreviations was always a part of this series, but the current level is having an impact on the readability.I would like to suggest Mr. Clancy to stop solving the problems of the world with this series and let Mr. Ryan rest.",0
3310,"A book that you were meant to read: If you read Seven Storey Mountain, you were probably meant to read it. One of the customer/reviewers said ""I doubt that any of us would have heard of him or his writings if he hadn't become a monk. As a lay writer, he would have been forgotten long ago."" That's true, I'm sure. But thanks to the Holy Spirit, Thomas Merton became a Trappist Monk, wrote this and other spiritual works and now many are brought to God through his writings. The book doesn't have to be ""great literature"" to get across a good message. I don't think Merton was setting out to write a literary masterpiece and the book should not be judged as such. It should be judged as the story of a man's life. As for Merton's spiritual dabblings... why does the scope of his journey make his journey any less valid? We are all searching - should we search on only one road? If you don't want to read this book, fine. If you do want to read this book it's because you are meant to.",1
3311,"Fun, but short.: I'm a fan of the show, and I like this style of game. The puzzles are pretty straightforward. The AI is good, the music and sound effects sometimes drown out the one liners of the characters.I ended up breezing through this one. The Mall level was the hardest, but it was fun to play.This game breaks no new ground, or deliver anything unexpectedly spectacular, but it was a good solid play, and a helluva lot of fun.

If they are indeed ""surface mountable"", there is no hardware in the package to do that. I contacted Intermatic/Malibu and after a week or so they sent me an email suggesting that they may have accessory parts that you can buy from them to surface mount these lights. If you plan to surface-mount these, be aware that you can't do it with the supplied hardware, you might be able to order accessory parts to do it, and if the accessory parts do exist, it will take forever to find and order them.I was able to mount my lights in a hanging position without the parts, so ultimately I was satisfied with the product.",1

While there are some pretty good rides left out of the book, he covers a very good sampling of the best near the bay area including rides from all around the area. Suggestions on where to park, where services are available (and warnings about where they are not available), rough topological profiles, very complete route sheet distances and even a very decent amount of history relating to the areas of the routes is included. In cases where different books are suggesting routes involving the same road areas I have found Ray's rides usually to be the better suggestion. It is true that there are some long rides included in the book, but just a few, and they are great rides that are worth the effort.",1

Paretsky ably draws out the darkness of that old City That Works, showing that it sometimes works because of nasty people doing bad things. This time V.I. finds herself targeted by far-reaching media moguls and bad cops as she fights to find the truth behind the death of an immigrant woman.This is a great story, so much so that I wanted more. I want to know what happens to V.I.'s relationship with Murray--something left hanging at the end. But that's why this is a series and I can't wait for V.I. to come back. She is a crusader but she is filled with human flaws and doubts: a wonderfully drawn character.",1

Spooks were exactly what I needed. While Ming Xia is definitely the star, it should be said that she is a stallion among thoroughbreds, to give the rest of her group credit.

Then I started having problems. It kept shutting-off, I found myself cleaning it every weekend. While this took little effort, the Ionic Pro failed to operate properly. I returned it to Wal Mart customer service. They indicated the item was outside their 90 day return policy. So, I contacted Ionic Pro directly. When I spoke to their customer service representative, she gave me a confirmation number and had me fax my purchase receipt. She stated that I must wait 48 hours before contacting Ionic Pro again. Additionally, she indicated that I would be charged $29.95 plus shipping for a replacement product.

Well, there are 8 sections with different primary language entries, but unfortunately, as a native Chinese speaker and a student in linguistic field, I cannot figure out the way the Chinese words are organized, neither by pronunciation nor stroke number. For example, in the Chinese section, ther first word is ""juji"" (to gather), the second one is ""ju-zhi-xianwei"" (polyester), and the third one is ""tui"" (leg). I don't see any logic in this sequencing, linguistically or realistically. There is no instructions explaining this works. So, there is no way for me to use this dictionary. Judging from my limited Japanese knowledge, the Japanese words are not arranged in alphabetical order either. If this is also true for the Korean section, 3/8 of this book is not usable.",0
3324,"A letdown: It is very hard for me to like this film after seeing My Architect. Pollock is in love with Gehry's work, which is fine, but it does not a good documentary make. In fact, I'm troubled that the only Gehry detractor in the film is a bald and effeminate architecture critic unable to articulate that as outrageous and weird Gehery's buildings are, many thoughtful people find them merely silly. Some years after Gehry's death maybe, just maybe, will his estranged son create a more robust documentary.",0

The whole door is bending front and back, not sure if it is going to hold on my toddler.This is the second Regalo easy step door that I am buying. I bought the shorter version (with one extension only) first and it worked perfectly. However, I need a door for a wider opening and bought this product with two extensions. The way the extensions are connected allows them the structure to bend. One connection works fine, but two of them makes the whole structure to bend front and back, no matter how tight you fasten the bolts. The other problem is that you cannot fasten the bolts beyond certain point without preventing the door from opening/closing.",0

This one in particular went into my Honda GX200 motor attached to a pressure washer. I noticed an immediate improvement in smoothness and starting after installation. I've never had any quality issues with any NGK plug I've used over the years - quality is top notch. Be sure to size the gap to your particular application, however, as the factory gap is not universal to all motors. (unlike some modern automotive plugs that are pre-gapped to a specific distance and are not meant to be adjusted)While it is convenient to get this item by mail, the value is dependent on cost and availability from local retailers. Therefore, weigh the current cost of this plug against the time and mileage you'd spend getting this for less at a local store.It is easy to recommend this high quality, long lasting plug for your your next small motor tune up.",1

Seeing another so inexpensive did not make me wonder about quality. But maybe I should have.These fans are not terribly powerful. The design of the unit itself is unbelievably inefficient. The air blows up at the laptop, and it gets trapped as there is no outlet for the air. I can compare it to the other fan I had -- that one had air flow upwards to cool off the bottom of the laptop and then shoot out the sides of the cooling unit. It was much more efficient.Please, carefully look at the design of this unit. Look how the fans blow air upwards... and then where is it supposed to go?I'm buying a different one right now.",0

Even though alot of the movie plot was extremely technical, it was presented in a way that everyone could understand what was going on. I loved watching this movie because the suspense was very intense. I was on the edge of my seat for half the movie. Instead of this being a movie based on attempting to cure the world and fix the problem, this movie was based on survival. Extremely intense movie that gets my 2 thumbs up.

I like the touches of humor, intentional (and sometimes unintentional) and the ending was a bit of a surprise. I would be very interested to follow up with the Dragon's Son and see where he winds up. Not the best I've ever read, but held my attention well and I went straight through all three books.",1
3362,"Decent, but I wouldn't buy it again.: I find this really isn't necessary. I could connect the iPod directly to my computer via the USB port and it operated the same way, except it was lying down on the desk instead of standing up in the dock. If it weren't so expensive I'd give it more stars.Another issue I had with the iPod -- and I recognize this is MY fault, not Apple's -- if you are one of those people who, like myself, become overjoyed by the arrival of a new product and immediately tear into it without stopping to read the directions, BEWARE! I was unaware it comes with two different dock covers for the 20gig and the 40gig iPod, and inevitably in my excitement I connected the wrong cover. It is not designed to unattach! If my handy Boy Scout fiance hadn't been around to detatch it for me (with difficulty), I'd still have the wrong cover connected and I probably wouldn't even be using it. Of course, that's my fault entirely for being overeager. Just be warned! :o)",0
3363,"scattered and uninformative: I purchased this book based on the fine coverage given to other topics in the series, Literary Criticism and Politics, and am rather disappointed with this selection. The author favors an extensive use of conversational examples, a strategy I would otherwise find appealing if not so interruptive, over any narrative or memorable structuring of the topic. The concerns of sociologists are introduced willy-nilly, and the reader might be convinced that the reason sociology is not a science per se is not that there are difficulties with experimentation and reproduciblity, but that sociologists lack a game plan entirely. If you seek a book that will help you speak about sociology with any insight, look elsewhere for something less impressionisitic.",0
3364,"Where's the Plum?: A single mother of two becomes engaged to her polo instructor after knowing him only a few days. This is a story Ms. Evanovich had written earlier and resurrected it now that she's famous, adding some things to it for this publication. It promises to be like the Stephanie Plum novels, and it does not deliver. Characters are wooden. Dialogue is corny. There's no excitement. The only suspense is at the end, which perks up the story but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the book. Very disappointing, when this writer is capable of so much more.",0

From an evolving landscape that reacts to your every action, to unlimited freedom of choice in the decisions that will effect the game's outcome, to boundless secrets, and the promise of over 100 hours of game play. What we got was what XBOX RPGs are famous for, linear game environments, predictable character development, and a game that you can complete thoroughly in about 30 hours. If you weren't expecting Fable, the game is entertaining and full of action, beautiful to look at, and admittedly the Legend of Zelda for the XBOX. If you were, you are probably left feeling manipulated into buying a product that otherwise you may have rented and finished in a weekend.",0

3368,"Great clock radio but limited snooze: All in all this is a great clock radio, very well designed. The one flaw I've found is that the SNOOZE is fixed at 5 minutes. Some of us find that too short and there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust it. One nice feature is that even with headphones plugged in, it still wakes to the radio. Normally plugging in headphones cuts off the external sound, but the alarm is an exception. Well designed, in this respect at least. Also nice is that the alarm sound gradually gets louder.",1

SET ME FREE, and SLITHER are the first two songs most fans will recognize or have heard before and those two songs rock. FALL TO PIECES, SUCKER TRAIN BLUES, DO IT FOR THE KIDS, BIG MACHINE, HEADSPACE, hell the whole album is worth listening to. If you are a fan of GNR or STP, then this album is for you.

Officer Rigg clearly had issues by not letting go of the past; something many of us face at one point in our lives. His game was interesting and there was an amazing ending I didn't see coming. Saw IV may not have been the best in the series but the writers kept the ball rolling and did it effectively.,1

However, after using it for two months the screw that holds the silicon knob in place on the lid started falling out. There are no threads holding the screw in so every time I use the espresso maker and wash it the knob comes off and I have to fish out the little screw inside the pot. It does make great espresso, but it's not worth the aggravation so I am currently shopping for another stovetop espresso maker. I don't know if this is a common problem for this type of espresso maker or just this particular brand. At any rate, I won't buy another Primula.",0

I find Claire to be a vibrant, lively, provocative singer who takes wondrous musical risks. Her CDs are generally appealing. This is not one of them.I have to agree with many of the reviews of this CD on this site. I was quite upset that less than half of the tracks feature Claire and of these few tracks, she sings duets with someone whose voice does not work well with Claire's. Although the CD credits both parties, the album cover is deceiving. It is not a Claire Martin CD. I would have preferred to have downloaded only the tracks with Claire's vocals. It would have cost me less money.",0

3384,"No better than rape: What happened to safe, sane, and consensual? The girl wasn't given a ""choice"" at all. As another reviewer said - no is supposed to mean no. In this book no = permission to rape. Condoms seem purposefully ignored, the psychologocal issues in the men's need to ""share"" are both unrealistic and icky...The sad thing is that this could have been so much better. The sex scenes, when they aren't being abusive, are great. With more creative thoght the menage could have worked way better...for instance the girl could have initiated the group interest (the seeds of that are there and could have been better developed). The abuse story is a weak plot device at best - why not have some other relationship between the three men that doesn't leave such a foul taste after reading this.Yuck.",0
3385,"unfunny: I expected a funnier season. Most of the stories I found boring and annoying. I don't know, maybe I just get older. KITH were still young and had a lot of freedom to do any stories on any topic. That's cool when you are young. I think season 1,2 were much better. All of them are older now despite that seasons seem still fresh. I wonder if they would still do same episodes or they would cut some of them out now.

3389,"Not as good as his other books: I love Gavin Edwards's other books. 'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy, When A Man Loves A Walnut, and Deck The Halls With Buddy Holly were hilarious and had great illustrations. However, I was really disappointed with this one. The ""misheard lyrics"" seem much more contrived (does anyone really hear ""my goat knows the bowling score"" instead of ""Michael, row the boat ashore?""), and the illustrations (which are the real meat and drink of these books) were not only unimaginative and badly done, but many were blatantly sexual, which I feel goes against the simple, childlike atmosphere the illustrations are supposed to create. There's nothing wrong with a blatantly sexual misheard lyric, but my problem is with the illustrations. I'd been looking for this book for a long time, so you can imagine how disappointed I was by it.If you're looking for a book on misheard lyrics, get his other books.

Sting is brilliant as the tough as nails, stand up Dad of the one of the main characters who only wants his son to stay on the straight and narrow. But the true anti-hero of the this movie and the one to keep your eye on. He is the 'muscle' for the top mobster. He is a dichodomy - both a gangster and a caring father in his own right.

3396,"Interesting, informative book.: I had read and enjoyed 'Blink' and I am happy to say that ""Tipping Point"" is just as enjoyable. Malcolm Gladwell discusses the theory that a trend or idea builds slowly until it 'tips' and shoots into the mainstream. He identifies the people who are essential in establishing trends: the Innovators, the Connectors, the Salesmen, and others. He uses examples from how Hush Puppies was saved from bankruptcy thanks to a few kids in the New York club scene to why we all remember Paul Revere but not William Dawes, even though they both rode out to warn the countryside that night. If you ever thought that small changes are useless in overcoming a big problem, ""The Tipping Point"" may well change your mind.",1
3397,"Hello! This is a ""Recruiting"" movie: 1. You don't get the CIA to actively help you, and ""divulge"" secrets especially for your flick unless there is something in it for them.2. The whole premise of the first 1/3rd of the movie is to make the CIA look like a big Gen Y sleepover/campout.3. Pacino's George Bush inspired rant about ""Our cause is just"" and how in a world of right and wrong ""we choose right"" is obviously an appeal to the post 9-11 mentality. The CIA probabally fed the dialouge to the producer/director because it had worked so well in thier focus group studies.This is a CIA advertisment with some plot development thrown in.The last half of the movie could be considered a stand alone story, but first you have to sit through a CIA ""infomercial"".Not that it's a bad infomercial, but still underhanded and obnoxious if you see it for what it is.

3399,"Meh.: Some of the stuff Clamp does is just wonderful, and some of it not so much. This falls into the latter category.Females are always portrayed in this book as needing a male - the mothers have their son do all the work AND have him steel for him. The kindergarten aged girl in the book is obsessed with having a boyfriend and settles on a thief (who's a forth grader). The females are clingy, whiny, and useless.The males aren't any better. They do whatever they are told, coddle the females, and all but one don't seem to have any moral backbone. The one teenager who says that steeling is wrong is portrayed as a food obsessed bizarre person.The artwork seems very juvenile to me. It's not even close to the beauty in XXXholic. It's the kind of artwork I'd expect from a late seventies animae (think Voltron).All in all I'd skip these books and go for something with more plot and more depth like Angelic Layer.",0

Gaffigan combines dry wit, with a slightly more absurd comedic style in his act. He is also known for giving his own running comentary on his act in a softer voice, often from the viewpoint of an audience member. Overall, this album features some of the funniest comedy to come along in a while and is truely worth picking up for anyone who enjoys intelligent comedy, with a bit an absurd twist.",1

It's so full of mistakes that portions of it are literally unreadable! And it is extremely difficult to find specific sections on how to treat the conditions it discusses. For instance, if you want to know how to treat a fungal infection, there are too many responses when you do a search for it, the index is completely useless, and the table of contents (which you can't even link to directly) is almost completely useless. After all that you'll need to find out how to treat a headache, but you can't! I have encountered similar problems w/ other Kindle books, but I excused it because those books were free.

Therefore, those members of the tribe who did not possess the intelligence and foresight to prepare for a period of no food---died. China, Japan, Korea, America, and Europe get cold. Australia, Africa, Central and South America do not. The less intelligent genes don't get thinned out, because there is an abundance of food year round.

When I saw that this teapot had a way to stop the steeping process, I was enthralled.I drink tea throughout the day and I drink the lighter Chinese teas. I don't like the bitterness of tea that has been oversteeped. The greatest thing about the teapot is that it really does keep the tea warm for 2-3 hrs in room temperature. For boiling hot tea, I usually keep my thermos handy with boiling hot water and pour 2-3 cups of hot water into the teapot at a time. (Good tea leaves are reusuable for at least 5-6 pots in a day.) I'm so happy to have such a aesthetically pleasing teapot on my desk at work and not having to use the lower grade tea in the teabags anymore. The infuser is also large enough to allow leaves to fully open and get the full flavor. The tea balls work somewhat but this works perfectly.",1

It helped me to understand why my son was so fussy (10-15 hours of unconsolible crying per day) in the first 3 months of his life. It helped me to understand that I did not cause this behavior and that there was not much I could do to prevent it. And it explains what you can do to help your baby sleep once the colic has stopped.

Checking the Mattel web site found that they do not sell them online but list a fair price for the MSRP. However, buying online the price seems to be more than double the MSRP when you include shipping and handling.

3430,"Looks alot better on tv: I would not have given it any stars if I had that option! I should have read the other reviews before buying. I have to agree with everyone else, it is flimsy, and unstable. The braces dont want to stay on it, and most of his cars wont fit in it. You would think that because of this, they would have included some cars with the playset. I wasnt exactly cheap, especially since I purchased it with no discounts. Do yourself a favor and avoid! Unless you like to spend hours putting something together that falls apart within minutes.",0
3431,kid sized aerobed: Its just a kid sized aerobed. Works just like a regular aerobed except the pump is detachable so you don't have to worry about your kid messing with it.It does make some noise when the kid moves around but its not too bad for us. Doesn't bother my daughter or my wife and I at night when she is sleeping on it. I like the raised side feature. My daughter moves around alot when she sleeps at night and so far she hasn't ended up on the floor yet so I think the raised sides works as designed,1

3433,"The Sixth Sense: Hello, everyone! For those of you who have not seen The Sixth Sense, you are in for a taunting, suspenseful ride! This movie totally blew me away (I saw it twice) with not only its intelligent plot, but for its menacing atmosphere. Haley Joel Osment is a sure Best Supporting Actor Oscar contender, for he is one of the most superb actors I have seen in quite a while. Bruce Willis shows that he is more than an action hero with a sensitive performance. The Sixth Sense will frighten and amaze people with its storyline. An exellent investment.",1

3435,"It's OK but I wouldn't recommend it.: If you have a lot of stapling to do, a manual gun can really start to hurt your hands. I had been using a manual gun, and decided to give this electric one a try. I keep alternating b/n the two, but I think the manual one is easier to use and the staples are much flatter. I think this gun would be great if the part you pressed used your whole hand, like the manual one. Instead, you have to press the gun with only 2 fingers and it's pretty tough, especially after you've been doing it a while. I would not recommend this product.",0

3442,Great Product...but costs $70 each year to update: The garmin is great. But I wish I had known that is costs $70 a year to update your maps. The updates are essential as construction is constantly changing the face of our roads. My garmin has already lead me to several wrong locations this year (I bought it in Oct. 2007).The cost of updates is vital information to the consumer and Garmin is deceitful for not letting the consumer know that ahead of time.,0
3443,"""Mr. Kim, at ease before you sprain something."" --Janeway: This was a great start to the series. We are introduced to characters that have a lot of potential for growth, and a setting with possibilities limited only by the writers' imaginations. Unfortunately, their imaginations turned out to be more limited than the series premiere seems to promise. By the end of Season Five, the series had begun to taste rather stale in the mouths of many fans. As we enter Season Seven, we can hope that they will finally ""push the envelope"" and take some chances with the characters. It is episodes like the pilot that make us wonder just what *Voyager* could have been . . . maybe even *should* have been. All fans should see this one; it's fun to see unfamiliar tension between some of our favorite characters, and the Delta Quadrant has a really ""fresh"" feel. One wonders if the writers ever watch this episode and think about all the possibilities they neglected in six years . . .",1

It can be used as a summary, a resource, a starting point to seek further information. Using a search engine to locate sites with content equivalent to those listed in this book would take days.

3450,"pointless: The author didn't really talk about everything..... In many states you need a food handler's permit to cook food to be consumed by other people, or even to serve it. Often you must cook it in a commercial kitchen. Most of these ideas wouldn't work, because you must have a great deal of talent or a very large amount of starting money, such as ideas like a store window painter, or a jewelry maker. Most people would rather hire professionals to actually get the work done, then to trust something to a kid.

3451,"Factual reading, but little else...: I read Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform for a presentation, but I wouldn't have purchased this book on my own initiative. The book is filled with facts and opinion polls, which only reveal the fickleness of the American public -- claiming that public schools are deplorable one year, and excellent the next. The authors inform the reader of what reforms didn't work, but offer few ideas of how to implement change. The book has potential, but falls unfavorably short of expectations.",0
3452,Not much luck: I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.,0
3453,"Best for True Beginners: What I like about this workout is that it is broken up into 5 ten minute sections - I like this because it makes the workout go by faster and I like to know that I am spending 10 solid minutes on each body part (abs, buns, legs, arms and then a total body stretch). This is a very basic workout - nothing especially unique or challenging - so it is best for beginners, but advanced exercisers can get more out of the workout by adding heavier hand weights and ankle weights. I found the cueing to be somewhat off - it seemed that the instructor was constantly yelling out - 4 more! when there was really many more reps (slightly annoying!). And I wasn't impressed by the power stretch section at the end - it was just a very basic boring stretch. But other than that, Cindy is a good instructor and if you do at least the 4 ten-minute toning sections, you will get a decent full body workout.",1
3454,"Lacks the ""wow"" factor.: This book is a good read about one of the greatest players to ever lace 'em up, but....it reads more like a review of his basketball career rather than a true look inside the man Larry Bird.

3456,"A story of friendship & faith: This book deals honestly with the question, ""What do I believe when God doesn't respond the way I thought He would?""It's the story of two best friends, one of whom gets cancer. When everyone in the two friends lives pray, asking for healing, and God doesn't heal--what then?The women's frienship and their relationships with their children, and others is very inspiring.This book has an emotional intensity that is very compelling.

3457,"Broke in less than a month: The concept behind this bag is a good one. I like the idea of being able to quickly remove the bag when I lock it up somewhere.

I am basically a novel reader, but I do like travel adventure and that's how I approached this book. I loved the part about the ship in 1857 and really could picture what Mr. Kinder described, although some illustrations and diagrams would have helped. I loved the description of Tommy as a boy. I read all the technical stuff, didn't understand it that well, but could follow it and that's due to a definite talent Mr. Kinder has for description. The only thing missing for me was some info about Tommy's adult life. He must have one, despite his monomania about the deep sea. Does he have a wife, a girlfriend? Does he have dinner with Mom and Dad on Sunday? Something to make him a bit more human.",1

Shame on Zebra Romantic Suspense for producing a book with so many blatant errors in it.Repetitive phrases are used; 'heart pounding', 'hung the moon'.

Several different singers and styles lend enjoyable variety, and many of the tunes are so catchy they stay with you (in a good way--not akin to ""It's a Small World""). I didn't feel that the end of the album was as strong as the beginning, but it's still growing on me, so I may change my mind.",1

3510,"Will we ever hear the masters?: The Seeds have been dismissed since they first arrived on the scene. This collection won't help that appraisal. Too bad. This is primal, grinding stuff that in the original vinyl configurations rocked with a unique, twisted snarl like few others from that era. The first album in itself, in its mono original form, is unlike any other. But this collection is just another excuse to recycle poor-sounding replicas of the masters. Plus, it lacks one of The Seeds classic, ""Out of the Question, often covered by bands in modern times. Too bad Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman were unable to secure the masters as they attempted to do several years ago due to ""Sky's people,"" whoever they may be.",0
3511,Cathloic Study Bible: I had this book in just three days and that is from the day I placed the order. It was wrapped up very nicely. I was not real sure who to purchase this book through but Amazon had the best price and I see I made the right decision,1
3512,"Still reading so far it is very good.: Although this book is not exactly what I thought, I am learning a lot and it is well-written. I am still reading and not finished yet, however, I would give it 4 stars. I was under the impression that Dr. Mitchell had experienced extraterrestials while exploring the Universe, and was speaking about his experience; however, it is not at all about that, but more scientific, explaining the relationship between matter and energy and how it operates in our Universe. A lot of it is quite over my head; however, I am learning and understanding what he is saying, which surprises me. This proves his writing is superb, if I can understand the subject matter.The Way of the Explorer, Revised Edition",1
3513,"Stay FAR Away!!!: Seriously. This is one of the worst produced DVD's ever. I can't watch the movie because the quality is so bad that it's distracting. If you are watching it on anything bigger than a 2 inch screen you will be sorry. The company that put this out (Fusian) should be embarrassed and should never be allowed to put out another DVD again. I only paid a couple dollars for it and I still feel ripped off!As mentioned in the other review they actually put a splitscreen view of the before and after of their ""remastering"" job. It's almost worth buying just to see it because it's such a joke. In fact, it took me a while to figure out which was supposed to be the remastered side.I would like to write about the movie itself as I was looking forward to watching it, but with this DVD that will never happen.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING RELEASED BY THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY (FUSIAN)!",0
3514,"Wonderful Book!!!: I have always fought against my curls, but this year I decided to embrace them. I bought ""The Curly Girl"" and followed some very easy step by step instructions!!! Now, I LOVE my curls!!The most important thing, for me, was getting rid of my everyday shampoo/conditioner. They were drying my hair! I now only use products that are labeled ""no SLS"". I find them at the local health food store. Yes, they are a little pricier, but since you don't wash your hair in the ""conventional way"", it lasts a lot longer.I get more compliments on my hair now and even my husband (who isn't a curly hair fan), loves it.If you have curly hair and are ready to embrace it, give this book a try. You won't be disappointed.",1
3515,"Hilarious: I'm a big Woody fan so it's hard for me to relate to those who can't stand him, but this is one hilarious film and I've seen it dozens of times. Sure, it's got the production values of a home movie and there are some head-scratchingly stupid jokes, but there are also more memorable belly laughs than in all Adam Sandler's movies combined.",1
3516,"A Bit Different: This hypnotic horror film from 1986 is for the movie fan with a different taste. The cheap blood and guts scenes are worse off because of the roller coaster movements. The interesting but nauseating movements of the camera are intense if you&#65533;re stuck in the eighties. In my opinion they could have cut the fat and made this a short 30 min. T.V. show. One plus is that it&#65533;s a little freaky which makes it scary to a degree. The other plus is it get boring when you give up trying to understand the movie in a movie concepts they intend to entice you with. I watched this with my girlfriend so when she got bored with the movie or somehow scared by the odd images, I was there to hold.",0

The rain and wind speed/direction is only an estimate of the last 10 minutes AT BEST, or day, week, month.second. the software did not work nor does the manual have any instruction on how to use the software.

I could list a review of every song but I won't, because I don't feel there was much to say about each song that would be different. They were all poorly written, poorly produced, and the audio quality is terrible. She needs to get up on her feet and learn to help herself. This is pretty pathetic, honestly.

I have even tried reading this one alongside ""English Traditional"" Bibles; like NIV, NKJV, KJV, & NASB, and it seems like the CJB (Complete Jewish Bible) conveys more accurately the thought of the day that it was written in.

The pictures are okay, but everytime I print one there is an annoying line running up the left side. Sometimes stray colors get splattered on the image. And when the paper comes out of the printer it catches on the corner, so every picture I've done has an annoying little bend in it.You're much better off taking your camera to a local drug or department store that has one of the big Kodak developing machines you can operate yourself.

3537,"Being the game player, I was terrbily disappointed.: Yes, I did indeed think that since the movie was titled, Final Fantasy, it would at least incorporate some of the game series into it. By that I mean, some of the meat of the game. The magic, summons, monsters, towns, people, character interaction, etc. Problem is, all this movie had was the small character interaction. It seems the only thing they took from Final Fantasy was the plot line, and that is so sad, as the games were about 100 times more richer than this movie. The graphics were awesome, but the voice-lip synching was not. I got dizzy trying to follow Baldwin's character when talking, as his mouth barely moved. Only the old man comes across as 100% real. If you really need this move, go rent it as the price to own it, isn't worth it.",0
3538,"Artistic metal: This is one the best metal bands around. It is very difficult to find realy good bands now a days. There are lots of bands out there that produce one or maybe two good albums and then fall away. Meshuggah has a long career and they have many good albums. The last three albums are for me personally the best, but then again it is a mature end product of a band that developed over 10 years. I'm such a die hard fan now that I actually want all there full length albums. Catch Thirty-Three is an amazing piece of work (art). Metal gone Tool. A story that starts with song 1 and ends with the last track. I like it when bands make you wanna listen to all the tracks. Not just a a hit song or three. Brilliant stuff!",1
3539,"Awful: This is truly one of the worst books of poems I have read this year. With the exception of a handful of poems, this book was not ready for publication much less to win the Bakeless Prize. The faux intelligence, the vapid imitations, the lifeless and lackluster lines: a book in need of serious editing. I refuse to go on and on like others have done here. Basically, if Grotz hadn't studied with Komunyakaa (the judge of the contest), and if she hadn't been a Bread Loaf fixture for over five years, she would never have won this contest. Every famous poet in America can annoint this book, but it doesn't change the fact readers will not be duped. Grotz, a would-be Empress, is wearing no clothes.",0

3543,"A ""Must Read"" for Anyone That Cares About Middle East Peace: This clever solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is right on target. In Dr. Rothblatt's plan, everyone wins - America, Israel and Palestine. Israel's security concerns are overwhelmingly addressed. Palestinians would have a place to call home and be free. And, best of all, America would demonstrate, finally, that it cares and is willing to be even-handed.As a Palestinian American, I can tell you that Palestinians dream of nothing other than to have the same basic human rights that we do here in the USA. This proposal would turn all Israeli and Palestinian energies from fighting to nation building. My two grandfathers were very proud to have left Palestine to serve in the US Army during WWI. They were even prouder to become American. If you could hear them from their graves at Arlington today, they would be shouting ""Two Stars for Peace"" NOW.",1

When I opened the box when they arrived, there were 4,000 nails scattered in the bottom of the shipping box. The plastic containers they come in were completely shattered. Just 1 small piece of bubble wrap in a box that was way too large to be shipped in. I sent them back. The re-order was a little better. The nails were intact, but the tops of both plastic boxes were shattered, and unusable. I store the nails in the cordless nail gun boxes so its important the tops fit tight. Until Amazon gets the shipping worked out, buy the nails locally. The nails are great. The 1 star is for Amazon's packaging.",0

The book itself is printed as if it were an old primer; the font and illustration style make this a quaint book to have in your collection. However the smooth, machined paper choice keeps the illusion of an old English storybook from being complete.A word of caution, these stories are not the deluded, bright, mindless Disney tales. They do have 'bite' and should be reviewed before any small child bedtime story ritual. The stories are wonderfully bizarre and gruesome, and are perfect for a quick entertaining read.",1

I also took for granted that the best audio facility would have been employed re-record the track of a film this important cinema history. Well, I was wrong on both counts and badly wrong at that. It's almost as though someone found a 16mm print that had been left outside in a garbage dump for twenty years and mastered it rather than go through the expense of restoring this masterpiece.

Really, there must be 50 jousting scenes and the all are exactly the same. Movie also includes the worst villian ever; his dialog is stupid, trite, and over-the-top. The final battle includes a stare down between him and Heath that goes back and forth for what seems an eternity.

The constant double exposure and fading in and out between images makes it hard to concentrate on what the narrator is trying to convey. It is sort of like a project for film techniques class. The soundtrack is great if you like punk, but does not exactly add to the experience. If you want an art movie, buy it. If you are looking for the secrets of the universe, buy a book.",0

The characters are flat, their dialog is hollow, and they're devoid of personality. The author tells you how to think and feel rather than the reader making those decisions for themselves. A page turner, but only to get to the end of the book. In fairness, the book started out presenting an interesting scenario of the chaos found when a supersonic plane is hit by a missile but it was all downhill from there.",0

The higher the sensitivity the higher the volume at a given setting.Basically these are a pathetic excuse for earphones from a company like Koss.

Very disappointed that the characters are different, in description,personality and portrayal. The author's style of writing is hard to follow; not smooth reading at all. I stopped reading halfway through the book; didn't want it to ruin the TV series for me. I will NOT purchase another Walt Longmire Mystery book. Regret that I purchased even one.",0

Also some great interviews and articles. There are also about 8 appendixes with lists of cover songs, novelty songs, tributes, etc. A terrific book but one not yet available on Amazon.

I heartily recommend the 1st over the 2nd. In fact, the 2nd edition is actually missing material from the first - even though the 2nd is ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE of the first.This is the worst part.. the best reason to even own the 1st edition (the only reason basically IMHO) is a section near the back of the book. And get this.. thats the only part they took out for the second edition.Thats right, they added a bunch of useless text, and gutted the only thing that made the first edition of any value.I have both on my bookshelf, the 2nd edition is in perfect condition and collects dust.

Second of all, the strings are a choking/strangling hazard, and thirdly and most importantly, the mobile does not attach securely enough to the arm and it was constantly falling off into the crib. It even fell right onto my baby. After that, I threw it away. I have read on the internet that many other parents have had this same experience. This product should be recalled!!",0

3602,"Decent compact binoculars: I bought these in July 2012 for birdwatching. They are easy to use, and provide a fairly crisp image even at far distances. I find that I have a hard time centering my eyes on the eyepieces, though, even with the extenders. I have to hold them away from my eyes and at a bit of an angle in order to see what I'm looking at. Also, something happened to my first pair, where something came loose inside and each barrel lens was loose - one eye would look at one thing, while the other eye was focused in a different direction. I sent them back to Olympus and they sent me a brand new pair, no questions asked. I don't even know how they broke, I was using them fine one day, then the next they were wobbly. So, kudos to Olympus for a quick replacement. I have a pair of full size binoculars that are my go-to pair for serious bird watching, but when I'm hiking or otherwise more mobile, these do the trick.",1

Well, this product was more than disappointing - the pieces just would not stay together at all. I don't know whether it's because they are softer and more flexible or what, but nothing he built would hold together, in fact most of the time it fell apart before he was even finished building... what could be more frustrating than that??? No one at our library could remember the brand/ make of their blocks, but obviously they are not all the same. I would not recommend this.",0

Mine lasted 2 years and 4 months before I started to notice cracking and then a matter of months before parts started to fall off.I most likely will purchase another pair as I had over two great years and have not found their equal in a sealed can.

The Unrated Director's Cut of Saw III clocks in at 121 minutes. The blu ray gives us only the unrated version, at 113 minutes. Why? It joins the original Saw on blu ray, offered in an R rated form. Yet, parts 2,4,and 5 are the longest versions offered. Why would blu ray get the lesser versions of part 1 and 3? No idea. As for the picture and sound, well they are crisp, loud and all they should be.

3654,"Kallmaker gets better and better...: Karin Kallmaker continues to amaze me. The books get better and better. In my opinion this book may not be the steamiest, but certainly is the most well written of them all. It has a more complexity in it's story line than most lesbian novels and holds your interest without fail. I can not overlook it's quantity either. How many times have you bought a book that's so thin, with large type, it equals a 30 minute sitcom? This books content is vast for this style of writing. I've always wondered if Naiad had a built in page limit. For once I'll say this is a great one and a half hour movie.",1
3655,"Being Caribou: Having read the book, I was curious to see the movie that had been made at the same time. I would recommend that interested people look at both.The movie doesn't capture the sense of exhaustion and long travel that the book does, but it shows the heartbreaking beauty of the landscape and the wildlife. One element not mentioned in the book is the little toy George Bush who rides along on the trip, his plastic eyes appearing to consider what he sees.In the end, I don't think anything said in the book or shown in the film has any chance to override the wishes of people who have no values other than power and profit. If nothing else, though, the film provides stunning visual documentation of a place that may soon be damaged or even wiped out entirely.",1
3656,pretty good low budget horror: i rented this movie cause some of the death scenes looked cool and they were the only thing that keep this from a 5 star is the annoying accents and the setting. if your a fan of blood and gore and dont mind a lower budget than usual you should enjoy this film. the ending death scene is very creative and original,1
3657,Roddy Piper at his best!: I have an original book and its a great classic! Piper as his best. I liked him when he was a heel and this is when wrestling kept me glued to the TV. Piper's Pit was great. A must have for every Piper fan!,1
3658,"Great, inexpensive handheld vac: I'd really like to give this 4.5 stars. It sucks (in a good way!) -- it definitely has power. The hose could have a little more strength in it for using in the car. The brushes work well on carpeting -- my stairs with their ugly carpeting have never looked nicer! The price is great -- I didn't want to spend a bunch of my hard earned cash on something as exciting as a hand vac. Also, the cord is long enough that I can vacuum my car all the way across the two car garage without stopping to find an extension cord. So if you are looking for a hand-vac, stop here and buy!",1
3659,"She's Definitely Got Something.: I don't normally pen reviews but nikka costa's CD is a fantastic piece of music that everyone should own. i would liken her to a modern day janis joplin with an international flavour. she's got the blues in her voice and her soul just pours out with every note she takes. there's an established sense of self and fun woven into several of the songs and the ones where she's scraping the depths of pain, you can feel the tremble of her vocal power as they rip from your speakers. fantastic work...great singer. looking forward to her next album.",1
3660,Good sound: The speakers produce sound quality that is more than adequate for their design. They are an excellent choice for a person looking for quality on a limited budget.,1

3662,"Very poor quality: Judging from reviews and from my own experience, the quality control on these must be very low. If you're lucky, you get one that works perfectly. If you're not lucky, like me, the female connectors are either too tight or too loose.One of my female connectors is too loose. It's so loose that anything I plug into it simply slides back out. The other female connector is fine. If I had bought it at Amazon, I would have returned it, but unfortunately I bought from somewhere else so I'm stuck with it and will have to just throw it out. Not a big loss, but frustrating, especially when I need it.I'll buy the replacement from Amazon, but it won't be this brand.",0
3663,John Wayne Collection: Of all John Wanes movies this is one of my favorite. Not only does it have John Wayne but Donna Reed now what could you ask for. I love this movie so much I watch it often & each time it gets better. So many GOOD actors in it & such a great love story. Fact is my copy is getting bad & I'm going to have to get another one myself.I can not say enough how great this movie is.,1
3664,NOT PORN: These movies are terrible in the acting but most of the guys in the movies are pretty cute. The movie's dont show any erections so if you think this is some porn its not. Everytime they show guys messing around they dont show the penus. If you like to see guys prancing around and kissing then you would like these movies to watch not to listen cause their acting is terrible.,0
3665,Yawn: It probably reads better in print. The audio has a juvenile intonation. Not recommended for in- car use if you tend to fall asleep at the wheel.,0

Of course, I have tried to call customer support for an entire afternoon and only get an answering machine. How's that for customer satisfaction!? Wouldn't you expect, for $179, that you'd receive a product that lasts more than half a year? My advice: Steer clear of this one.",0

It had lots of power but seemed to fall over when the beaters were on it causing it to turn on & almost broke my fingers, (this happened several times).I purchased a 2nd mixer because of the power, but the same things happened- the mixer FROZE up, B&D; refused to honor the warranty. Several times this mixer fell over, turned on & almost cut my fingers off.I sincerely feel this mixer is a danger & I DO NOT recommend this mixer for safety reasons as well as performance reasons.",0

3671,"Fabulous resource: This book is (surprisingly) beautifully written, has helpful illustrations and photographs, and has a wealth of useful information. The book is written so that average people without any particular knowledge about roofs (like me) will find it very helpful and interesting, and I also believe that it would educate even those who are more experienced on the topic. I cannot say enough good things about this book -- it is the best money I have spent on a non-fiction book in a long time.",1
3672,Oh My God!: I'm speechless. I read the one about the Binion's murders and playing in the world championship of poker and I thought that it was an extremely sophisticated look at the world of gambling.

If you play cards you need to read this book.,1

Why pay extra to see an inferior image? I wonder if it is the remastering or this particular disc I got, but this kind of quality is deeply disappointing. I certainly had no such problems with 'A Passage to India' and ' A Room with a View'. My BluRay player is a top of the line machine so I am sure it's not my hardware. So what's wrong?",0
3677,"a quantum step backward for romantic relationships: I should have listened to the reviewers on this one. It is toobrutal in its portrayal of rape & physical abuse. These characters are not people who belong in this genre, or perhaps in any form of literature. One cannot feel anything but disgustat the ersatz hero and his attitude towards women.Nor can anyfeelings of sympathy be truly garnered up for the spoiled bratheroine. I only hope that young readers don't pick this book upor, if they do, they see it for the travesty it is. Shame onyou, Ms.Robards",0

The album is well put together with great tracks that Biggie light's up with energy and imaginative lyrics. One needs to only hear ""Rap Phenomenon"" and ""Come on"" to get their head's ringing, and for the laid back chill factor, check out ""Notorious"" and ""Big Booty Hoes"", but nearly every track will be respected by any Big Poppa fans.

WRONG! It was NO whereas smart, funny, charming, SEXY and wonderful. I was really let down. It was full of characters I couldn't have cared less about (except Davey, who I always thought was charming in Temptation and his young niece Dilly (again from Temptation) and the entire plot was confusing and boring. I really wanted to give up on the whole thing --- but thought I needed to give Crusie the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, it never got better and never got sexier.The characters from ""Temptation"" meant a lot more to me and I think I was hoping for more from them, and an expanded story from the first offering. I was bummed and let down.",0

3687,"good read: A good read. The author might have done a slightly better job tieing the characters together earlier in the book. There seemed to be too many folks shooting too early in the book to keep track of who was doing what and for what possible reason. I was frequently on the verge of saying ""This is too confusing (complicated?).""",1

The camera rapidly jumps around left, right, up, down, back into the audience and even has the image rotated sideways now and then. Enough!

3699,"Makes Good Toilet Paper: Although this book delves deeply into the twisted psyche of the GMAT test writers, it is little more than a supplement for Kaplan's GMAT Review. I found the abundance of typographical and math errors to be rather confusing. Also, several example questions lack explainations, often leading me to question the accuracy of the selected answers. Most of all, after reading the Kaplan book, I thought this book was rather stale and trite, and, aside from the abundant amount of paper contained within, a waste of money.My suggestion is to definitely buy the book by Kaplan, and then, if you feel like you need extra practice, download the practices from GMAC and scour the internet for free tests, because my ""Princeton Review"" has just become 432 pages of toilet friendly recyclable paper.",0

I have read several of the books in this series and have yet to be disappointed.One thing I love about these books is how they are each different in the story line. There is no set pattern of events in the story. I have read other authors with similar themes and they have a set pattern like there will be heat between the main characters drawing them together, something happens to separate them, someone gets kidnapped, then the big rescue...blah blah blah. After reading a few books in a series with the same pattern of events, it gets old quick. Not the case with this series.The main characters have good chemistry and the story is unique in each book. Characters from other books in the series make an appearance as well, which is always nice. I am looking forward to the next book. I am hooked.",1

This volume is difficult to put down; this is not simply a reference book but also a book that can be read from cover to cover.

It covers the complete sinus area from frontal to maxillary, and the the velcro strap keeps it securely in place. I agree with other reviewers who complain that the heat doesn't last long enough - but perhaps that's because sinus infections are so miserable you want the relief to last forever. DO NOT OVERHEAT - follow the manufacturers instructions about heating in the microwave. Overheating won't offer longer relief, since the pad will be too hot to place on the skin - and it may ruin the pad.",1

Rarely, have I been so terribly wrong about a book. It was terrible, the characters were barely developed, the Kender was a Kender in name only and didn't seem or act like one at all, Fistandantilus was portrayed as kind of a wimpy crybaby, Raistlin was barely mentioned, and the entire book seemed to be bereft of interesting dialog. In fact, what little dialog there was, was mostly B movie quality dialog, along the lines of, ""Hey, we need to go over there.""""OK, lets go over there.""""Gee, I like this place, lets stay for a while.""""OK, lets stay for a while.""In other words, it was boring, tedious, drawn out, and had absolutely no point.

Well the box set is plastic wrapped to a piece of cardboard. This in turn was placed in a box three times larger and shipped. No other packing material.

3732,"Very versatile and popular toy: I bought this for my son when he was 3 months, and it has been a favorite toy for more than 6 months now. I bought this to wrap around the handle of the car seat so he would have something to look at / play with. Well, as it turns out, I never really do that because it was a bit awkward and he couldn't really reach it. So, I just put it in his lap when we go in the car. He just loves this toy. It is very easy to grab for little hands, and has many things to chew on/explore. He seems very happy playing with this toy and often falls asleep with the toy still in his hand. Now that he is older, we still use it in the car, and also use it in the stroller, wrapped around the front bar. I have 3 kids and have acquired many baby toys, but this is probably the very best one.",1

The non-live tracks are accoustic or non-album making this a valuable addition for any Corrs fan, the high price due solely to the fact it is a Japanese Import. The Corrs at their pre-remixing best. Buy it !!!!",1
3734,Save Your Money: Save your money and purchase the REAL stories 'outlined' in this cheap book put together to ride the wave of The Perfect Storm.

He takes what he wants, no matter what happens to anyone. I love Richard Burton, but his line about making Anne queen ""Even if it breaks the earth in two and throws the two halves out into the void"" just too cheesey.

Imagine the difference it can make to have the text available to accompany the hands-on instruction.

So if you ordered this item it would cost you $13 with the shipping, at a time when most stores sell the 10-12 oz box for $5.

I did remove some ""tics"" from the tracks that I ripped for my sometimes deejay activity, but most people probably wouldn't notice the difference.

Sadly, it is just a rehash of the other book.

The authors pick a famous battle, do general research about it, find some fact and then try to prove or disprove it by--digging trenches. And using ground-penetrating radar, and other high-tech devices. It's quite fun, and interesting what they still can turn up after hundreds of years.

The video really shows how mindless and inconsiderate that some people can be by gawking at and taking photos of the Amish as they (try to) go about their business. Sad that some tourists consider it proper to stand at the edge of a cemetery and watch as a burial is taking place. Despite the number of problems that tourism causes, there are some benefits as well, since it allows many Amish to remain in the community despite the fact that high property values makes purchasing a suitable farm difficult.",1

There would periodically be a quick hiss or whoosh similar to bad FM reception.

Once it is taking apart, nearly everyone with some experience in playing desktop computers would know what to do next. However, this book and the companion disk do a very poor job in this. It shows how to diassemble an IBM notebook, which is perhaps the easierest to disasseble.

The dialog was insanely monotonous and without direction and could have been written by anyone with a sixth grade education. The book I read was 450 pages long but could have been written in about 40 pages. The remaining 410 pages goes in circles around non-events. Nothing happens for tens of pages , then something minor happens, then tens of pages more of dribble. I can't believe ANYONE would give this book more than one star. !!!

Stem cells/DNA are programmed externally via the membrane, non-random evolution suggesting deliberate genetic mutations, EEGs that pick-up brain signals outside of the body , the placebo pill effect, etc.In short, he makes good arguments how environmental factors, both at the cellular level and by extension on the body as a whole, can indeed be responsible for one's present condition.Where I felt cheated, was the ending. It seems the whole book is leading to the climax that will explain what exactly one can do armed with this information. Unfortunately, it comes up short. Basically, he says positive affirmation and/or willpower aren't effective since they involve the conscious mind.. instead what is needed is to reprogram the unconscious. How do you do that?

I haven't tried recording live music with it yet but I suspect good results from that also. The unit is small enough to set on my desktop without taking very much space. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because there is no on off switch, you have to unplug it. So if you need a small mixer for the price, under $50 this one can't be beat.

3801,"Surprising: People would know a lot more, and know a lot more quickly if all books were written as clearly as Robin Smith writes. His version of Aristotle's Topics covers only books I and VIII. But Smith makes clear what Topics is all about and why it is so valuable today. Also, Smith doesn't assume that you teach philosophy every day, so he doesn't just concentrate on disputed fine points that only bored academics care about. Smith actually gets to the heart of what the book is about. Authors of philosophical texts often think mentioning what the purpose of the book is, and how the knowledge it imparts is to be used, isn't important. Either that, or many authors don't really know themselves what the subject is about and write confusing verbiage to hide the fact they don't know what they are talking about. Smith is one of those rare individuals that understands what Aristotle meant and can clearly tell you.",1

I was therefore skeptical, but desperate to be able to play my ipod in the car while commuting to work. Wow, I am so glad I took the plunge. This is a great device and has worked perfectly for me. As other reviewers have mentioned, the key with this FM transmitter is to use it in international mode (IN) and set to 87.9. It will not set to 87.9 if you do not put it in IN mode. I live just outside the DC area and have no problems with reception. Also, as an FM transmitter, it will work with the new ipod touch 2G, but will not charge. Still worth it to me.",1

The only good character was Patrick. I really liked him and was rooting for him, not Charlie, the entire book.Save yourself the time and read Catcher in the Rye instead.",0

After a number of phone calls and emails, i still don't know if a quality drop is normal, or if I had a bad unit. ReplayTV refused to exchange the unit because I had not bought it from them directly - fortunately Amazon is easier to deal with and has issued me an RA for a refund. In addition to the audio problems I found pixilation to be a problem at the standard and medium settings, and experienced a number of lock-ups. I also found the space management to be poor - it's basically up to the user to manage disk space. I would have lived with the glitches if the audio could have been straightened out. Guess I'll wait for the next generation.Dwight",0

3818,"Proceed with caution: This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel.",0
3819,"Not judging a book by its cover....: Okay, so there's nothing particularly heartbreaking about this work. And its not really one of ""staggering genius""... for that you'll have to consult Pynchon or Joyce or any number of other postmodern authors. Eggers, however, is likeable and readable because he represents his reader more than most other writers. He is neither lofty nor pretentious (except maybe the title, which we soon realize, duh, is smartassery), and we seem to understand him. He is normal. He has suffered loss. He has failed at aspects of life. He shares in our post-graduate apathy. What makes this book a success is its accessibility. It is funny; it is interesting; and it was, at least for me, a quick and meaningful read.I highly recommend the paratext too---the preface(s)/acknowledgements/even the copyright page is witty.",1

The hikes are ranked from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest) making it simple for us to figure out what the four kids could handle. By taking trails rated over ""2"" we saw almost nobody else on the trails for most hikes. It seems that a vast majority of visitors to Yellowstone do not actually want to hike and having this book made it easy for us to have an uncrowded, pleasant experience. Very detailed, easy to find trail heads from the descriptions. Highly recommend this book, it made our experience fantastic. We also bought ""Yellowstone Treasures: The Traveler's Companion to the National Park"" which offers more info on the actual park. Together these books covered everything we needed to know.",1
3823,"A must for any Miss Saigon fan!!: Miss Saigon is my favorite all-time musical! I was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind Lea Salonga is and always will be Kim! But I was pleasantly surprised. Joanna Ampil as Kim holds her own. While she doesn't have the vocal range of Lea, she has a beautiful, crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of Kim. She expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love, pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own. The rest of the cast is superb (especially the amazing Ruthie Henshall as Ellen) but make no mistake, this show belongs to Ampil!I also fell in love with some of the material left out of the LCR. There a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story. ""Back in Town"" stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies. Anyone who has fallen in love with the story of ""Miss Saigon"" will appreciate these added gems! This cast recording is definitely worth a listen!!",1

3829,"Three Legged ""Dogs"" Ain't Half Bad!: With the untimely passing of Gene Eugene, I wondered how well the next project from Lost Dogs would turn out, or if they would even continue to record without him. 'Real Men Cry' definitely lacks Gene's contribution, but with Terry Taylor's creative genius, it is a toe-tapping collection of country style numbers with a touch of bluegrass (In fact, every time I listen to the CD, I picture myself sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair with a cold glass of lemonade in hand, head bobbing in rhythm to the music). Harmonic vocals and great guitar work permiate each track. And once again, Terry's lyrical talent shines. NO SHADOW OF TURNING is my favorite tune, but A CERTAIN LOVE comes in a close second. I get the impression that Terry was thinking of the band when he penned THREE LEGGED DOG and it seems he's returning to his 'roots' with the style of music performed on this and the last project 'Gift Horse'.",1

This was quite literally the worst movie I have seen since the Street Fighter movie with Jean Claud Vandam. While watching Transformers 2 the viewer gets the distinct impression that the editor and director were simultaneously napping while a page cut the final product together. There are whole chunks of plot missing which are retroactively filled in by a one liner from Shia Lebleuf. If this is your idea of a 3 star product or higher, you should probably burn your dvd player because it is making you less of a human being.",0

3834,"A glorified episode, and not a good one at that.: Brainiac Attacks is all about the fight scenes. You'd expect this from a movie with Attacks in the title, but really, a lot of really ridiculous fighting. Brainiac arrives on Earth, fights Superman, Lex Luthor gets involved, and... That's pretty much it. There's one or two emotional moments where Lois is poisoned and Superman has to travel to the Phantom Zone to harvest a cure. But even this interesting subplot fails to meet its potential. Brainiac basically follows the ""Power Rangers"" formula where near the end he adds on pieces until he's just a massive tank-thing. Not quite the intelligent Brainiac I'm used to seeing. Oh yeah, and the thrilling dialog like Lex Luthor saying ""Super Duper Man"". Okay, setting my harsh feelings aside, it's probably worth seeing once and a fun (but disappointing) watch if you liked the Superman Animated Series.",0

Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the on/off switch.2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened), making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids.Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead.",0

Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman give marvelous performances as usual, but to me the gem of this movie is Claude Rains. The man is excellent in his Nazi role. He plays Sebastian as subdued but dangerous, controlling but easily manipulated by everyone.The last scene is simply thrilling and is worth watching the whole movie for that long walk down the stairs. Watch for the signature cameo and the shot of Grant seen from an angle in the doorway with the light behind him. Oh, so very Hitchcockian.Oh, if you happen to get the video with the trailer on it, I suggest not watching the trailer. There is a clip in it from the last ten minutes of the film.

However the net effect left me cold and yawning. The mix of Americans and Europeans intermingling with Indians in tourist spots of India like Varanasi and Dharamsala seems real formula stuff. Wonder why Mishra was hyped as the great Indian writer. To me this was the most inspid and uninspiring piece of writing.Maybe mishra should read more Rushdie and Seth and even Shobaha De.

I probably use it 3 times a week.)It looks like Amazon isn't currently caring the product. The current price from a seller is $70. I would say that's way too expensive and I'd try to look around for a better price.",1

3882,"Great puzzle toy for kids!: This toy was given to us as a gift when our twin boys were too young to use it (probably around 6 months). This was the first puzzle toy that they quickly grew attached to as well as be able to complete. They just loved playing with the pieces and shaking them to make noise. My boys are now over 2 1/2 years old and we have another baby (5 1/2 months) so we pulled the toy out again, and the boys are loving it all over again! Once our little one is a little older, I just know the boys will love teaching her how to use the pieces and fit them in the proper slots. Definitely worth purchasing if you're looking for a great baby toy! I even purchased one of these for a friend because her daughter was only interested in this puzzle toy when she came over for play dates.",1

Contacted the company via email (the method provided by Amazon) a week ago to let them know and see about exchanging the clock. I received an automated reply that the company was closed and they would contact me the next business day. I heard nothing from the, so I emailed again yesterday evening. Same automated message, but no response today. I am very disappointed by the customer service and am beginning to get angry.UPDATE- The company did finally send me a new clock a few weeks later along with complementary wonderful wall decals to match the clock. The clock is wonderful, as are the decals.",0

3889,"Gr-8 CD!: I feel this is a very good CD. It has a great compilation of very cool songs I hear often at clubs. Also, songs blend seemlessly together which is a real plus! The only reason why I rate it with 4 stars is that I was expecting songs with higher beats per minute, since I want to use it for my advanced-step class where we usually work with 142 bpm. The highest in this CD is 138. But still, it's great to work up a good sweat and have fun at the same time!",1

3891,A PRIMER ON THE FALSE RELIGION OF NEO-CONSERVATISM: This insidious book gives tremendous insight into the LEFT turn conservatism made a number of years ago. One must read very closely so see how truth became sprinkled with corrosive error! Many prominent conservatives have fallen victim to the author's clever intellectual trap! This book illustrates how the pollution of New World Order Globalism and disguised liberal thought crept into mainline conservatism and took over the Republican Party! A disturbing revelation!,0

3894,"Doesn't take kindly to Kindle version: It's not a field guide. If the sample function had worked, I would have realised that the illustrations were small, and black-and-white, despite the color cover. Since I can't zoom the images on my iPod Touch, it's like viewing a postage stamp. The detailed illustrations are useless. It's also for sportfish mainly, not reef fish. No key or arrangement other than alphabetical, so you need to slog through every entry until you see one that looks like what you have (in black-and-white).Wish I could return it.",0
3895,"Excellent, but somewhat dated, travel guide.: As long as the reader understands that this book was released in 2004, before Hurricane Katrina, this is still a very useful guide to New Orleans, especially the French Quarter. Some businesses have changed or gone under due to the lack of tourist trade, but the French Quarter had almost no significant damage from the storm. We visited New Orleans in June of 2008, so we took this book with us. There is a revised issue coming in the late Fall of 2008, so if your trip is after that time wait for the new revision. The information is very well presented, and the book is a great carry-around guide.",1
3896,"Horrible acting--i swear someone made this in their basement: The reason this movie was so highly acclaimed is because it has some touching moments, a controversial topic, and is funny at times. The idea of the movie is far better than the movie itself. And it has some of the worst acting and lines you've ever seen, and most of it looks like some poor schmuck had kids do this in his basement after giving them 5 minutes to memorize the whole script. And the budget for this movie had to be ultra cheap because the camera and sound quality are poor and even annoying at times. Reminds me of early John Waters films--but his are comedies and the poor quality makes them funnier. With Go Fish, it's just really, really bad. I watched it on cable years ago and my mom walked in and thought I was watching something my friends made up for fun. Don't waste your money.",0
3897,"Why Would I Buy This Import When...: ....there's no track listings here? True, they were a good group, and most import CDs are nice, but, for me, there needs to be more of an incentive. Buy sight unseen only if you're a true fan. Rhino Records has made a few good AWB collections....",0

Shelter Logic did e-mail and fax the instructions within one hour of a phone request, but had to wait several days for the hardware to arrive. Like I said, unacceptable!!!",0
3900,"Do not recommend...: I have not even used a whole box of the color absorber. In one load, I have a white t-shirt that ended up coming out a bluish tint. In another load weeks later, I tried breezy again and a white dress ended up with blue spots on it (which matched the blue color of the color absorber sheet). I was leary of the product in the first place, so I didn't even wash the reds or darkest colors with the light colors. Unfortunately 2 clothing items out of less than 20 loads were discolored. And in the load with the dress, I even used 2 color absorber sheets. I do not recommend this product at all. Luckily I got most of the color out of the dress, and the t-shirt is an older one that I can use for house work. Just don't want anyone else's clothes ruined because of this product, so I felt I should write a review.....",0

She is being harassed by a clients jealous and is being haunted by visions of a missing firl who is thought to be dead. She is pulled into a web of lies and deceit that will put her very life in danger.This movie is very good. It has a great cast, a pretty original story, and lots of twists and turns. The story is very interesting and will surprise you in the end. The atmosphere created gives it a very gothic mood. It's definitely a dark tale. If you haven't seen The Gift then you are missing out. I hope you enjoy it.",1
3902,Basic information: This book is great if you are looking for basic information. The pages don't turn very easily and you have to turn the book around to see the next page instead of flipping the page. Would not buy again.,0
3903,"Piece of junk: But exactly what one would expect for the price. I use it outside to wash the dobermans. I think they wanted to attack me for making them feel so 'ghetto'. The 5 modes are 1) where's the water?, 2) Is someone peeing on me?, 3) uh oh, it's leaking, 4) who turned the water off and 5) oh, there it is. Garbage!",0
3904,"Adapters for Video Cards to Monitors: The transition from a vga connection on my video card to a dvi-i connection on my monitor did not work. Someone had told me that it was not compatible, but since the price was not great, I thought I've give it a try anyway with the hope of improving my monitor's reception. The product should have a warning that using this adapter in this manner will not work. Plus, the design of the adapter makes it extremely hard to tighten the connection on the vga side because of not allowing enough room for your fingers. A very poor design.",0
3905,"GARMIN-C340 Street Pilot-The perfect navigator: Looking for a personal navigator on-line will yeild a plethora of navigating electronic boxes. But, who's is who's, what is what, this one or that one and why pay more or why pay less. The simple answer is to ask the people who have already purchased one. They can tell you the good points and of course the bad points. I wanted one for my father in-law who happens to need one that basically does all the work for you. The Garmin C340 fit exactly what he needed, easy to use, no real need to read through pages of instruction, very straight forward, uses real street name and not coordinates, finds gas, food and lodging at the touch of a button. What more could anyone ask for. The C340 is it...wa-la...we're here.",1
3906,"Disappointing: I bought a variety of GRE study materials, and the Kaplan cards were my least favorite. The words are good, but all that is provided is a simple definition. The Barron's flashcards have definitions, antonyms, a sample sentence completion and a sample analogy. The Kaplan cards were far more simple, which some people might prefer. I happen to prefer more thorough cards, so I was disappointed with these. The cards themselves are very small (roughly the size of the Chance and Community Chest cards in Monopoly) and are very, very thin. I guess some people might like how small they are, but I would have preferred something sturdier. Overall, there were too many deficiencies for these cards to be useful to me and I would not recommend them.",0
3907,"possibly the worst movie ever.: The only ""Laugh out loud funny"" about this movie is how I wasted two hours of life watching it. An absurdly ridiculous movie, not funny, and hardly anything made any sense. Maybe I was expecting a kinda 'Jurassic Park' or 'Lost World' with some funny characters thrown in to the mix, but men in cheap monkey costumes, a T-Rex with scooby-do type slap stick expressions, and no plausible plot, I did not expect. Ok , the two seconds that the monkey suited man fondled Anna Friels' breasts were....but, I digress. All in all, probably the worst movie I have ever seen.",0
3908,"Last Night of The Proms - music: Same comments as I made with the other CD ""Last night of the Proms"". This CD isn't as good and I guess I didn't read the preview too closely as this is only 'music of the last night of the proms' and NOT the actual Royal Albert Hall last night. Disappointing in that respect.Should have gone for the more expensive CD with the BBC etc because of the crowd participation and the Conductor's final address, the singing andchanting of the audience.",0

3911,"Junk: The holes on this filter are absolutely huge compared to the lint coming out of my washer and clogging the utility sink.

I tried a Nylon stocking inside of this, but it just made the water shoot everywhere.",0

My husband suggested I should have tryed blow drying it before peeling it for esaier peeling. It was a good suggestion but I did not try it as I had already returned the product. I was able to get a small enough section to test on a photo and it seemed to work well enough, however it is not useful on the larger scale I had bought it for. Buyer beware.",0
3917,"Terrible: This was assembled in the early 80's, most of the stories are written by women and reflect more of that time, the feminist thing, etc. and are written more descriptively than action-oriented. Indeed, I've only found one story that was even remotely erotic, but I'm a guy. I was greatly disappointed.",0

It's Chinese and you get what you pay for.I bought a Champion at Amazon after this one that I did use for my project. I could see the US stamping on that one in the picture. It was just 32nd inch larger.It cost more.",0

The copy I have is remastered for 5.1 Home Theatre and in 16:9 widescreen.The picture quality doesn't stand up to todays films but was still much better on DVD than it would have been on VHS.The movie itself is fairly light hearted and entertaining similar to many other action/comedy/romance type movies & shows of the 80 & 90s. If you are a fan of those classic movies and programs like beverly hills cop, baywatch, police academy etc this movie would slot right in. If you are a fan of Erika Eleniak then this is a must have that you will not regret purchasing.",1

3923,"boring: The scenery was almost all colorless, Winter landscapes. There were lengthy concentrations on dull colored grasses, up and down them, back and forth on them, in and out of them. I was very disappointed. Don't buy this if you are looking for beautiful mountain scenery with variety or relaxing music. The music was sharp toned and distracting although I have to say the boring aspect of it all did make me sleepy.",0
3924,"Don't think of the old showtrack.: When I recieved the CD I couldn't wait to give it a play. Soon my baissed ears told me that I liked the old soundtrack much better. Eventually I give it a few more spins and then went to see the film.How glad am I, I did that, it made me enjoy the film much more and now I love the soundtrack. A good addition to my collection of sountracks and musicals. I'm sure it will also appeal to a younger audience.Give it a listen.",1

I was very dissapointed in most of the Phantom of the Opera numbers. I really only enjoyed Music of the Night and Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.

I may be in the minority, but I would not recommend this video.",0

Also, it says it makes 32 ounces, but I was only able to pour in about 25 ounces of water. The design is very attractive and practical. The main reason I bought this was because cleaning is very easy. The infuser is basically a strainer that fits nicely into the body. This way it's works like brewing a cup of tea by just tossing the leaves into the water. The only downside to this design is that you can't leave in the infuser basket/strainer and pour the tea without some leaves falling into the cup, though they don't recommend doing it this way anyway. Also, many people prefer to remove the basket so their tea won't get too strong when you reach the end so it's a moot point. I'm happy with my purchase.",1
3930,"Unlucky Reader: This assemblage of stories about spoiled, vapid, and, worst of all, utterly ulikable young American females abroad is a shining example of how mind-numbingly poor Nell Freudenberger's writing can be. Reading her prose is like listening to a 17-year-old girl on the telephone with her friend -- a rampage of dead-end discussions and trivial details. Freudenberger throws around enough foreign words and phrases to lend to her excruciating tales the air of ""diversity"" required of any young author who wants to win awards and endorsements from the creative-writing-department Gestapo. This book is a pointless mess and a waste of time.",0
3931,"Complete waste of money: Like the other reviewers, I found this pot totally inferior to a Bialetti. In fact, I'd say it's a worthless product for two reasons. First, the coffee does not brew out in a quiet steady flow, as it should, but sputters from the time it first starts seeping out. You are supposed to hear the sputtering when it's time to turn off the burner, but because it's always sputtering you have to keep opening the lid (making a mess) to see when it's done. Second, and most critically, it brews so slowly that the coffee begins to burn (evident in the smell and taste) before it's even finished. I'm using proper heat and I'm not over-packing. I've been using various moka pots for years without these problems.",0

3939,"Excellent machine!: I bought this machine a few weeks ago, and it has received fairly heavy use since I received it. Its totally fantastic, and great bang for the purchase price. It consistently produces good seams with regular stitches, over a variety of fabrics. There are only two minor cons to the machine: there is not enough light over the needle area (solution, have a desk lamp) and the bobbin winding is not as automated as the manual says it should be...the automatic winding produces tangled bobbins that are useless. Winding them in the more traditional manner of older machines is much more effective. Overall, its automated features are a great asset to my aging eyes, as I no longer have to thread needles. Purchasing this machine has increased the quality of my sewing tenfold with no real improvement of skill. I wish I had had this machine a decade ago!",1

3948,"Great Concept, Cheaply Made: This toy is way too expensive for the cheap production of it! I love the idea behind it though. It folds up so your child can take it anywhere. The problem is that it never folds up very well and can break very easily if not folded exactly right. Also the swing never attached very well and when I finally got it to work, Sleeping Beauty never would actually sit. She slid right off. I guess this bothered me more thn my 5 and 2 year olds. They enjoyed it for a while. The plastic furniture gets lost, but that is not unusual for these type of toys. Unfortunately, I just ended up throwing this toy away. What a waste!! Again, this toy is way too expensive for what it is. Disney should start making better quality toys for our children.",0

More casual listeners would be better served by getting Sweden, 9 Black Poppies, or Full Force Galesburg. As a compilation of rarities, it is obviously rough and doesn't hang together like a typical Mountain Goats CD. That said, there are some great songs on this CD, from the opening song, ""Golden Boy,"" which are about peanuts, to ""Going to Port Washington,"" ""The Anglo-Saxons"", and ""Noticifer Birmingham."" Many of these songs are just Darnielle having a lot of fun. Sometimes, like on ""Golden Boy"", the results are amazing. Sometimes it only reminds you of how good he can be when he gets more serious. Overall, a good CD and a must-have for Mountain Goats fans.",1
3952,"House of Cheesy, 1-Dimensional Over-Writing: I completely and totally dislike The House of Dies Drear. The characters, had no depth, and were one-dimensional, the dialogue was stiff, and robot-like, and there was nothing in the book that I could relate to. I consider the book to be quite anti-climactic, lacking a major turning point in which the readers are supposed to be enthralled in. It had no twists, about two cliff-hangers, and was completely predictable. It was, in fact, probably one of the worst books that I have ever read.

I can't knock a band for being extremely prolific, and wanting to change it's style a little bit after every 100 songs, but Brighten The Corners was Pavement turning on their blinker to leave the two lane country road that represents my musical tastes, and Terror Twilight puts them on the exit ramp. It's mellow, it's thoughtful, it's nicely produced, and it bores me to tears. Thank God for the Silver Jews.",0

This game barely has a resemblence to the series. The cut scenes look like playstation 1 graphics. Also when you build your chopper the options are limited. On American Chopper I never saw Paulie do missions or race. When you are racing, he makes stupid sounds when you pass him. I never saw Hex or that guy with the patch over his eye on the series. Must have missed that episode, lol. I tried to sell this game at a yard sale for 10 dollars and a kid said it was too much. He must have played the game before.

Yes, temporary because the link will soon expire. I got the software once then I lost it because of problem in my PC. I contacted the company and waiting for the download link. Right now no response. Imagine if you spent $238 for the remote and $160 for the mrf-350 and you cannot use them because of the software.

Now I'm not a die-hard Phishead by any means, but I do enjoy their music, particularly Page's awesome keyboard work as I play keyboards myself. Anyway, my personal favorite Phish albums are those from Junta up to Hoist, and it seems like every album released after Hoist has seemed to be just a little more ""un-Phishlike"" than the album before, and Round Room, in my opinion, is no exception. To me, comparing ""Round Room"" to albums like ""Picture of Nectar"" and ""Rift"" is just like comparing DMB's ""Everyday"" to his ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" and ""Crash"" albums...that signature sound from the earlier albums just seems to be missing in the later albums. I didn't find anything particularly appealing on Round Room, which is a big difference from Phish's earlier albums on which I really like pretty much every track. But that's just my two cents...",0

3964,"Professional, Commercial, NO Passion: There's lots of competent musicianship here but I keep waiting to hear the passion that the blues signify for me. The tunes are occasionally catchy but otherwise these songs smack of covers of songs that have been made more palatable for a mass audience. The originals say a lot about the African-American experience, this album appears to eliminated most of that identifying emotion. There is more soul and passion in John Hurt's Corinna, Corrina than in this whole album. I don't hear anything ""natch'l"" and I don't hear the ""blues"". If this album turns others on to wanting to hear authentic blues, then it will have served a purpose, otherwise it's just a precursor to someone like Keb Mo.",0

Animals do not have the capability to relate emotionally with their environment as suggested in this book, and such a misrepresentation could cause children to form a grossly inaccurate understanding of wild animals in their natural environment.

Unless you're brand-spanking-new to garage sales or secondhand shopping, you probably already know most of what's in this book. And I thought the whole section on how to organize your secondhand treasures was a bit weird -- don't tell me how to decorate my house, thank you! Also, since this book was published in 1995 (pre-eBay), the ""Selling your treasures"" section is now worthless as eBay has completely revolutionized not only the selling process but also folks' newfound realization of the worth of their junk. Some useful tips throughout (the cleaning solutions section was good), but overall, not a book worth buying.",0

Frequent re-adjustments were required. Not a big deal but for me, it does require monitoring.",1

It appears to be designed by a male who's never been in a kitchen, like so many other inferior kitchen products. This cracker, while great at cracking open large nuts such as walnuts and brazil nuts, is absolutely worthless when it comes to small nuts like almonds or hazelnuts. With any small nut, you will find yourself having to search for the widest part of the nut to crack at the very ""top"" of the cracker. It will try and push the nut ""down"" (toward the wider part of the cracker) when it can't grip the small nut properly. You can spend 30 seconds just trying to position a hazelnut or almond in this thing before you can finally get it to cooperate. For this reason, I find this cracker worthless.",0

A person who started struggling to live like an ordinary man became a legend of his time in the ""Afro-American commuinity"".

Paramount, I would be delighted to give you my money for the original 3 films, but there is no way in heck that I will you give you my money for a second copy of Crystal Skull.I'm sure that someone is going to come along an criticize me for giving 2 stars to a collection that has yet to be released.

4007,"Worst tennis announcer ever: This book is typical of an announcer who thinks any sporting event is about himself and how much he can talk during it. I (thankfully) am not exposed to him on telecasts other than tennis but that is plenty.Do you think someone commentating on tennis matches for 10+ years would (or should) know NOT to talk continuously THROUGH the points?They should and he doesn't. He ruins every tennis match he talks, babbles and mutters over. His hallmarks are: long-winded never ending run-on sentences (about nothing), beginning to talk almost every time a player throws the ball up to serve (ensuring he will talk over and through the entire point), and dominating the amount of talking. If there are 3 announcers he will easily STILL talk 60-70% of the time!This book is more hot air from a know-nothing self absorbed announcer. More worried about what THEY can say during a sporting event than paying attention to what is actually going on.",0

I wish there were more Sign Language DVD's in the Einstein series because this sort of leaves you hanging. The search for DVD's between this age and schoolage where ettiquette, sentence structure, classifiers, etc. start to be discussed is void. It would be nice if signing could be taken for granted and included in children's programing as a matter of course. Our granddaughter does now look for hands to mean something and Signing seems to be a stronger language for her than verbal instruction. She usually smiles when she signs to us because for her it seems to be both a game and powerful. ""Adults"" get it when she signs. This DVD did make a huge difference getting her started. We have a deaf daughter (25) so it is important in our family to have these materials around for everybody.

Reading Mr. Card's review shows how disturbing this book really is. Especially since it is essentially the narrative of the Islamic jihadist. In reality it was the Jews in Israel that were fighting against well-equipped Arab armies. The Israelis had fewer fighters, less powerful weapons (including no heavy artillery in the start of the war) and were not backed by any other nations. They were self-reliant and this is one of the reasons they defeated the Arabs in 1948 and again in 1967.",0

4017,"Great idea, poor execution: McDevitt is a master of creating a mystery of cosmological proportions. When he is on, as for ""Engines of God"", the result is a poignant expoloration of the human condition within the context of the universe.Unfortunately, Infinity Beach falls quite short of these expectations. The beginning is wonderful, but then the execution of the idea fails. Character development is pedantic, and more time is spent on the actual footwork of solving the mystery, rather than developing the main theme of the novel.In short, the characters were un-memorable and it was a struggle to finish the book. If you want to experience the author at his best, my opinion is that you should read Engines of God.",0

But on the whole it comes off very well, especially when considering that the 'hero' is really an anti-hero. And that his thoughts and actions can be viewed as a parody of the self-serving, self-interested and self-promoting individual (or something like that).Anyway, it is a worthwhile, entertaining story and the reading (of the audio version) by West is excellent.",1

How long the baby nurses, where they sleep, at what age they sleep through the night, none of that is montessori! Different cultures parent differently, and one of Maria Montessori's main criteria for montessori education was that it be relevant to the era and culture that the child lives in. She never went into specifics on any of the crap that these authors go into.I think it is wrong for them to infiliterate their own parenting tactics under the banner of Montessori methods, I hope to find a book that is more relevant and true to what it advertises that it is on it's cover and cover notes.",0

Victor, abandoned by his father, Arnold Joseph, at the age of 12 becomes a bully but that is not the end of the story.

It is maximum output with minimum effor and a far cry from ""Moon"". If you want to hear a singer with an orchestra who does hit the note, try Linda Rondstadt's albums with Nelson riddle.

The speakers fit almost perfectly, although they are tall and easily able to be knocked off the stand.My only criticisms is that the plastic snap-on back panels do not fully cover length of stand, letting light shine through the small gap in front where the two angled panels meet. This is a minor flaw and is not very noticeable unless in certain lighting/placement conditions.",1
4099,be-sura sarod: Aditya Verma has done a fair enough job of playing the basic chalan or framework of the ragas through rigrious listining of the maihar pandits and ustads and this is evident through several catch phrases.however he lacks tayari or chops in laymans term. lets hope in future albums we hear more layakari (rythm) and tayari,0
4100,"this sucks: This plane is a piece of crap. It can barely flies and when it does fly it will only fly for about 5 seconds. I have had one good flight, it lasted about 5 minutes. And in the direction it says that the plane takes 45 minutes to build but it took me and my dad 2 and half hours. The cables that attach the engine to the rest of the plane hang out and get caught in the motor alot of the time. Also the controller has to be reset after every time yo turn it off. This is an over priced piece of crap dont buy it.",0
4101,"not THE most disturbing movie......: ...but then again, THE most disturbing movie was religous. Scary Movie is filled with sex, and masked murderers that must of been drunk. It has the crudest humor I've ever seen. it pokes fun at baywatch , the six sense, scream, i know what you did last summer, and many, many , others. it has alot of nudity, cursing , and stereotipical acts. it also has some funny stuff, and alot of potty humor.the only thing that is even near funny is the part where prince is tied up.the only reason i gave it two stars is because i probably couldn't make a better movie.",0
4102,Works great!: This paper arrived very very fast and was in great condition however I'm only giving it four stars because it arrived in an open box. The paper itself was wrapped though and it works really well so I'm still satisfied. I would recommend it.,1

4104,"Should be recalled ! Would have given 0 stars If possible!: My daughter received this for Christmas. Luckily, my husband and I put it together and played with it first. The net was a suprise-no mention of it on the ads or the box which I felt was mid-leading. The thing is so LOUD but the worst part is that the cars fly off the track (FAST) causing them to become little metal missiles. It hit my cat (thankfully in the leg) but it scares me to death to think of my daughter playing with it. We are boxing it back up and returning it. I have called the Consumer Products Safety Commission and filed a complaint. I urge everyone else who feels this way to do the same. Perhaps they will re-call these things before someone gets seriously hurt with it. I have tried to call the 1-800 number on the box but due to high call volume I must call back. Gee, I wonder what the calls are concerning. I wish I would have read the other reviews on this website prior to purchase.",0
4105,RUINED BY SONY ONLINE ENT.: Sony has completely destroyed what made this game stand out. The Combat Upgrade has been protested by the player base and has been installed regardless.

4106,"Just an all around very good phone.: After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars.",1
4107,"An ""A"" for effort.: Maybe not the best written movie I've ever seen (just my opinion), but I really liked its message. Tolerance, love, etc. Being truly Christian means we keep intolerance and bigotry out of our lives! Maybe this movie will open a few minds and hearts.",1

I ordered it to replace the one I've used almost every day for three years when the cord started separating from the body. The new one is noticeably more cheaply made. It does heat up just like the old one did but the hinge joint feels loose, the cord stiff and cheap and the whole thing like a light plastic toy compared to the old one.",0

In addition, the book provides interesting information on the Pa. coal region, Custer, Little Bighorn, etc. The information appears to have been thoroughly researched and well written. It's very evident that the writer believes that Billy Heath is, in fact, the sole suvivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn.",1
4112,"Too soft and no support at all!: I was expecting something that had a stiffer feel to it but the fabric that surrounded the pellets was way too stretchy. Due to the stretch factor of this cushion, I felt like there was no support for my wrist at all. I may as well have not used this cushion at all. I don't have a big wrist at all (my braclet size is 5.5""), so when I rested my wrist on the cushion, the fabric would give and all of the pellets would move out to the left and right sides of the cushion (as the fabric stretched out) and then it left me with no pellets beneath my wrist...which meant no support at all. This was really a waste of money. I am sure that if the fabric were not stretchy at all, then the shape of the cusion and would probably have provided the support I was looking for. Don't waste your money here.",0

By far Craven's darkest film to date, telling a story of murder and racism in a small, backwards Vermont town, c. 1950. A nice piece of cinema which is at once both a compelling drama and a well executed whodunit, featuring top-drawer performances (particularly Rusty DeWees, Bill Raymond, and Ernie Hudson.), and an appropriately eerie score by the Horse Flies. Not entirely faithful to the book, but how many films are? Worth at least a rental from anybody who likes a good drama.",1

4119,"Great Conditioner for someone looking to go organic: I have been using Giovanni's Magnetic line since I found out it has a very low hazard rating from the Environmental Working Group's website cosmeticdatabase.com It does not contain SLS or any other harsh chemicals and has a very pleasant fragrance. It definitely makes your hair feel smoother and softer. It does not build up in your hair over time and is a great daily conditioner for long hair, or really any hair length or type for that matter. I highly recommend the matching Giovanni Magnetic Shampoo to go with this conditioner. You wont be displeased, especially for the price, its a great product.",1

4121,"Are you Ophiophobic?: This movie really pushes the button of ""fear of snakes"" to the extreme. This movie was a horror flick and a comedy all on one. It does have it's laughs and scarey moments. But what this movie really does work on is the peoples' fear of being ""trapped"" and something that they fear most ""snakes"". Probably what would have been worse is spiders. I did like this movie but what made it unbelievable for me is the drug lord trying to kill the witness with snakes. You would think that he would have planted a bomb instead, but the snakes worked for fear factor. If you want to watch a fun horror film then see this one. I do recommend this film to anyone that is ophiophobic.",1

4124,"A Must Have for ALL Canon Digital Camera Owners: If you own one of the fantastic, compact Canon digital cameras than this is a must have.I bought a new Canon SD880IS for Christmas and the built in flash only has a usable range of about 10-13 feet. This is very typical of compact digital cameras. This is due to the small size of the cameras and small batteries. It is all a compromise. For most shooting this is not a problem as you can usually shoot without flash or are within range. However many times you need more flash range when shooting in large rooms, museums, concerts, and public places. The HF-DC1 solves this problem by giving you more range - up to 30 feet. This flash works with many Canon models, check the Canon Website or your camera owners manual for complete details.It is a must have for Canon digital camera owners. Highly recommended !",1

It would be cool if crowds cheer for you, instead of one or two people cheering for you.

When I listened to my music at a level that blocked out surrounding conversation, the whole office could hear exactly what I was listening to as if I had no headphones on at all. The reason I was ordering headphones and not earbuds was the specific reason of privacy and ambient noise blockage.

That is until you actually begin to use what you get from the book against whats in the test. The book doesn't cover quite a bit of material that is on the test, and gives you very minimal information about other things. It does cover replication quite well, and it has good information on setting up jobs/alerts/DTS/etc... It's a big book, but the vast majority of it is ""filler"" that uses overly complicated descriptions and LOTS of screenshots to walk you through tasks. Also, the included CD is useless. It has an a copy of the book on CD, and ONE sample test with just 45 questions (many of them from inside the book).

4158,"A story of two friends in a frightening situation: Number the Stars by Lois Lowry was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is a Realistic-Fiction novel set in World War 2 in Coppenhegan Denmark. The story is about a Christian girl named Annemarie who is 10, her family, and Annie's best friend a Jewish girl named Ellen who is also 10. Annemarie's family takes Ellen in to stay with them to protect her from the Natzies. Ellen takes on Annemarie's dead older sisters name to protect herself and Annemarie's family.

4175,Disappointing: Who in their right mind would compare Tapper to Norman Mailer? (Read: the author or his close friend) The book surely did not lack the titillating details of the Body's turbulent life. But the book read more like pulp than a serious political or biographical analysis. I was extremely disappointed; to say the least.,0
4176,Oh Dear: I bought the DVD as a Xmas present for my son - hence the delay between purchase and discovery. Unfortunately the DVD sent was not of the correct configuration for UK DVD players - so he hasn't yet seen it. Cannot comment on the product otherwise. What should I do?,0
4177,terrible color: There are no pictures of the 'assorted colors' and the brown it came in is the ugliest 1970's nasty brown carpet.I have another of these in cream which our cats love. I wanted to add another one to my office. I don't know where else to look for a cream colored one. I called some local stores that Lazy Pet website listed as a retailer and they all had the same scary larry brown too.,0

4179,"Lessons are repetitive and weak.: I've used this series for about three years for a Rescue Mission discipleship program. I love the series but this book is the weakest by far. The eight lessons are extremely repetitive. The other books have questions that stimulate good discussion of learning applications. That is not true for for ""Tough Times"".",0

4181,"Running With Bernd: One of the many reasons why I love Heinrich's writing so much is that there are so many fascinating little seeds of knowledge in every book. No matter what the topic is that he is writing about, there is bound to be some incredible piece of information that you would never have guessed would be related to that topic. For instance, this book is about running but you will also learn about camels. I have decided Heinrich is a multisensory genius who ties together the physical & psychological, the sensuous & the scientific. He makes you gape in wonder at the natural world that is inches outside your very door and inside your very body. This book also shows us a very intimate portrait of the writer as a young man and the inspirations he experienced that would influence his exciting life. After reading this book & two of his other books ""Winter World"" and ""Summer World"" I have made it my mission to read everything he has out in print.",1
4182,"26 Boring Pouches to Knit: Because this book is authored by a ""Rowan consultant"", I thought it was safe to buy sight unseen. Wrong, wrong, wrong!The book contains ""patterns"" for 26 bags consisting of two squares or rectangles sewn together. Mostly the patterns call for stripes, although some use bobbles, cables, sequins, beads, intarsia hearts, knitted flowers, or embroidered flowers as variations. The yarn color selections for the pouches are generally poor, and even the addition of metallic Rowan lurex yarn fails to add pizzazz.Accompanying ""how-to"" material is pretty much unrelated to specific problems of knitted bags. For example, there appears to be nothing about linings.If you want to knit bags, a much better selection would be PURSENALITIES by Eva Weichmann. Weichmann's book has patterns for handbags of varying shapes and sizes, including some that are felted.",0
4183,"Expect this one to last 15 years like the last one did: I purchased this exact same iron over 15 years ago - same model number, same color, exact same iron. The cord recoiler and the plug for the water broke last week, and during the last month it began to leak. When I received this replacement iron I was thrilled to see it was identical. I fully expect 15 years out of this one too.I am a quilter so my iron gets quite a workout nearly every day. The one that only recently broke ironed smoothly, temperature stayed true, the two steam settings worked perfectly, and I loved the retractable cord feature. When I'd take the iron to quilting classes others would use mine rather than their own (even the Rowenta owners) because of how well it ironed.",1

He makes the work into one overwhelming arch.I am fond of Previn's recording for EMI (it is beautifully played and his inner movements are thrilling), but his first movement lacks the inevitability of Haitink's; similarly, Previn's final movement lmost sounds comfortable next to both Haitink. It is a valid approach, but it will not leave you as shaken as Mravinky or Haitink.Slatkin leads a well-played and very moving performance, which is unfortunately somewhat undone by its low-impact sound.",1

I sprinkled habanero powder on the seed and feeding ports. This worked for less then a day.Day three I noticed half the seed was gone and there wasn't a bird in sight. When I went out to add water to the bird bath I discovered the squirrels had removed the top of the feeder, dropped it to the ground and most likely were the culprits of massive seed loss.Bottom line, IF squirrels are a problem, keep shopping. This feeder is definitely NOT squirrel proof!",0
4190,"Saving water: Tap water is out, bottled water is in. My valve was leaking and needed replacement or repair.

4193,"One of the best!: I've read a lot of books about what it means to live life as a Christian woman. This one is outstanding! Jan Winebrenner lists 17 spiritual disciplines and I thought the sections about the disciplines of secrecy and silence were fascinating.I checked this book out of the library and read it, as I usually do, armed with post-it arrows. When I was done, the book looked like a porcupine with about 50 post-its sticking out of it. I decided that if this book had that many excellent points, I needed to purchase it! So now I'll reread it, with highlighter in hand this time!I also recommend ""A Place of Quiet Rest"" by Nancy Leigh DeMoss, ""The Contemplative Mom"" by Ann Kroeker, ""Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World"" by Joanna Weaver, and ""When the Soul Listens"" by Jan Johnson.May God bless you richly as you pursue a deep relationship with Him!Please check out my other reviews of Christian books!",1
4194,"A Precipitous and Splendid Journey: No matter what your experiences, gay or straight, one cannot help but be moved by this young man's coming of age. This is not another politically correct maifesto of the gay political agenda, rather, it is a poignant, touching account of the author's transformation from boy to man. The work is a statement of who he is at his core, and how the events of his life brought him to know his true self.The writing is as complex as the subject matter -- at one moment simple, joyful and innocent; the next moment contemplative and brutally honest.Although the author and I had radically different upbringings, I cannot deny the similarities between our respective journeys into manhood. The book offers a very personal look at one man's experience yet the reader cannot help but reflect on his or her own.This is a touching, wonderful book.",1

Sometimes Brian uses tough coding which I can't grasp.,1

Trib Force member David finds a delighted surprise as he is attended to medically, to find out one of the nurses is a believer and becomes a new TB member. Nicolae Carpathia's identity is confirmed to the team as the Antichrist by Chaim, even as the world is fawning over the Beast's seemingly amicable nature. The lone rogue in Trib Force yet to be converted, Hattie, remains the focus of much prayer for her salvation, even as God delights answering that prayer. Tsion begins to teach believers via the Internet, and the Trib Force is graced to find a way to use fake biochips in lieu of receiving the official `Mark'. All peoples start their quest towards Jerusalem towards the showdown of their lifetimes.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers.",1

There was also no way I was going to leave my house with this stuff in my hair for 48 hours. I had to wash it out the next morning. Total waste of money.",0
4208,"I Beg To Differ - Stick With The Book: This disappointing film has none of the irony and wistful quality that made Alice Hoffman's book of the same name such a - well, magical read. The film instead is ruined by a rushed, connect-the-dots script that fails utterly to capture the nuances and charm that made the book such a hit when it was published.One reviewer characterized the film, which received mostly poor reviews, thusly: ""Barbie joins a coven."" To be fair to Bullock and Kidman, the ""Barbies"" in question, there wasn't much they could do with the awful script. That aside, the review could not be more apt. A good cast, including Aidan Quinn, an actor I greatly respect, can't redeem the bad writing that reduces the original material to cute gimmicks and a dreadful ending that not only doesn't appear in the book, but runs contrary to the book's underlying observations about the relationship between desire and wisdom.I cannot recommend the book highly enough. I cannot recommend the movie at all.",0
4209,"You call this funny?: A friend and I rented this, and then sat as our terriblefeelings of insecurity and childhood traumas were played out on the screen. It wasn't funny. I know what funny is.

My very old egg poacher could easily accept extra large eggs. Also...I found despite greasing each cup thoroughly a thin white fiil remains on each cup. A scrub brush does not clean this. One must use the course side of a dish sponge with repeated rubbing before storing.,0
4213,"A Crisis in Explanation: I suspect that buried somewhere in these 264 pages of largely unreadable prose is a rather interesting 20 page essay.

For a wider-ranging and more readable book, I recommend THE NUDE MALE: A NEW PERSPECTIVE by Margaret Walters.",0
4214,"Horrible customer service: I tried to set up remote monitoring and had a question on two fields in the set up. The manual didn't have the answer so I logged a question via email. I tried it twice because both technicians just referred me to the manual or provided a small amount of information that was completely unrelated to the question.I opened a call and after being on hold for 10 minutes was told that they don't support remote monitoring even though it's part of their product. I asked to talked to a supervisor, was put on hold for another 5 minutes, and then was told by the same person that the supervisor is just going to tell me the same thing. When I requested a call back he agreed and started to hang up. I asked what phone # he was going to use and he gave some # that wasn't even close to mine.This product may be good once you get it set up, but I'll never buy another product by this company due to the extremely poor customer service.",0

4217,"More a commercial than a game: The underlying games could be fun, but the pacing and DVD controls are terrible. You're forced to wait for 5 min of commercials at the start and you can't fast-forward (FF) or skip them. In the games, the characters talk too long and you can't FF there as well. An adult has to sit there to press the right remote key every two minutes. My kids, 2 and 4, liked the game at first but got bored in 10 min because the pacing is so bad. Very disappointing, especially for the high price.",0

Once we had no use for it anymore, we packed it up in a box with stuffed animals and put it on the top of my daughters closet. Just last week, we pulled it out because baby #2 will be here late June only to discover all the stuffed animals wet and the soother leaking. We called Fisher Price and since ""it wasn't within the 1 year warranty for workmanship"" they did nothing for us. C'mon?! You just put it in a box for 2 years and it's going to break? Doesn't sound like quality to me..........They sent us $10 to make us happy but I told Fisher Price WE ARE NOT HAPPY. Obviously they know their product is shady if they send $10. Product was never dropped, misused, etc. They did go into labs reports about it being 98.4% water and certified non-toxic. It's ""gel-like"". Buyer beware.",0

4224,"Lousy low budget story, great softcore sex scenes.: Overall, a pretty bad film.

I am so inspired by her wonderful voice, I am promoting her new CD by passing out stickers that look like the cover of the CD. I was asked to do this by an important music company.

4234,"Disappointed in Michael Connelly: I am a Michael Connelly fan. I have read every book and anxious await the release of the next. I read his books because they are light, but at the same time he does not write like a second-grader (like many popular fiction writers do). That said, this was an immature and actually silly book. I felt like my very young children could have written a more interesting and less silly (I say silly, but at times I was almost embarrassed for the writer that he thought some of the ritual antics of the characters would be amusing) book. It was unbelievable. I hope that this atrocity will not be repeated in the future!!",0
4235,"Very good: I was initially turned off by a crude description early in the book, but then I found myself increasingly drawn into the story and characters. The protagonist works as a middleman for a supply consultancy, arranging for Nike supplies to be shipped from China to the US, and deals with vendors' complaints and worries. He's engaged to a fiancee who's perfect on paper, but he finds his late buddy's widow more compelling...and the bond between them is growing. When he gets a cancer scare, he's forced to reassess his work and love life.This was a very interesting read, well-written with believable characters and funny moments. The cancer scare doesn't drag the story down, but instead calls the main character to action. There's a good blend of introspection and storytelling. I liked this much more than ""The Book of Joe.""",1

Maybe file this under growth, but growth would imply they were building on their roots-- they aren't. This album has nothing to do with their previous efforts. Also, the songs are weak. A good batch of songs would have diverted me from the new-fangled production, but these songs are utterly wack. Lousy lyrics. Which is such a shame, because their last two albums put them in a lyrical class with Bruce, Lou Reed, and even Townes Van Zandt, and I doubt any rock album ever captured a sense of place like ""Kids In Philly"" did for thet great city.

All the songs were good. There was no need to skip any of the tracks! My personal favorite was ""Crash and Burn"" because it is very true. Someone is always caring and looking after you, even if you're having an awful time in life. All the lyrics to the other songs are really incredible as well. ""Two Beds and a Coffee Machine"" is really depressing while ""the Animal Song"" is fun and catchy. If you are into really heart-felt lyrics and a guy with an awesome voice, go buy this CD now!",1

4251,"Xcruciating. Xcess. Xcrement.: Being the biggest Xzibit fan that exits, I am sorely disappointed with the album and direction Xzibit is headed. Restless will sell more albums than his previous releases, but the quality of his lyrical work has drifted into what is wrong with L.A. rap now. Too much gloss, not enough substance. Weak attempts at funk don't manage to measure up to the excitement of Xzibit's character. Lyrically, he's pretty decent, but not great. The hooks are too wordy for what he's attempting. He's been saying this album is 120% better than his last album- he's dreaming. E-Swift, Thayod, Sir Jinx and DJ Muggs brought real heat to those previous albums. Dr. Dre and company don't really do anything for this album that is senses shattering. It's an attempt to include Xzibit to the ""L.A."" sound, but that sound is played. It's time for new music, something exciting. This ain't it. ""Only in the money for the fame Xtra large, that's Paparazzi.""",0

4254,"Does What I Want: This zester/grater does what I want. It is a very fine grater and to explain, when I use it on frozen chocolate, I get a powder. This was what I was looking for because I already have tools that make thin strips. This is excellent for very fine grating.I would caution that this is very, very sharp and because of that I kept the plastic cover that slides over it to protect other things in the drawer and anyone who may not know what may be lurking in my utensil drawer. I may have kept myself from injury a time or two.I have used this for zest, nutmeg, chocolate, hard cheese and other things I can't think of right now. It is not heavy or awkward for me. It works exactly as it should and it cleans up easily. I hand wash mine because it's that easy.I could probably go on and on with a glowing review, but this is something that does one thing and in my opinion does it well, is well made and I'm glad I bought it.",1
4255,"another good nicholson film: this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an 18-year old,for a petty theft,to prison.one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his 8-year sentence.the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the 2 show him what he's missed all within a 5-day period.jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance,while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances.other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days,in a brief apperance.this is a very good film but i wouldn't say it were great,for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again.it definitely is worth seeing though,at least for nicholson fans.",1

It's really cool, at times it's kinda freaky and I don't recomend it for anyone under 12 or 13 because the monsters will scare little kids.

Vivid description and at times very funny but also very touching- especially if you've lived in the South-- or have a mother! The characters and their adventures are memorable; it's one of those books you read over and over. Far superior to ""Little Altars Everywhere"", the book this is a sequel to. Rebecca Wells obviously matured as a writer after writing Little Altars, which does not have to be read to understand this book (in fact I would say don't read it at all, just enjoy Divine Secrets). Divine Secrets is bound to be a favorite book passed from mother to daughter-- or in my case daughter to mother! Enjoy!",1

After I hit the ""play movie"" a third time I realized I now had to skip forward to get to the actual movie. The movie starts off with a cute girl with a nice accent getting killed in the first scene. So much for her, I thought, but then we do a flashback to 6 hours ago when a guy, whose face is covered in blood is talking to a policeman at the station (apparently one without any water) and he is telling the investigator to watch the movies which leads to a flashback during the flashback.

This, as the previous book: ""The Secundus Papyrus"" begins as a murder mystery in the eighth century in Ravenna, Italy. The main characters are: Gretorious (the surgeon) and his wife Arcadia. She is training to practice medicine to treat women. The plots are interesting and move quickly along.What I especially like, is that I learned quite a bit of Roman history for that time period. In summary, this book is an intelligent, easy read and I learned about how men and women lived at that time.Of course, I recommend buy this, but read ""The Secundus Papyrus"" first.",1

I say that as a kind of criticism of this book which aims to put all Conservatives in one basket, and all Liberals in another. In other words something in me opposes this simplistic way of operation, and the presumption that one side is simply all right, and the other side always wrong and stupid.Isn't it possible that the Liberals are more right on some issues, and the Conservatives more right on others?On the whole as it is biased with a conservitive agenda telling me what and how to think,I would not accept it all blindly . Each person has to think through every issue by themselves. And usually when we do think we do not come into total agreement with others but find areas in which we think and believe differently.",0

Even though Enid was never that interesting, I still think she should have at least a small roll in these books, after all that she and Liz went through. Also, whatever happened to Heather Mallone?",0

These three veteran musicians together is just a great musical combination.Just like Jing Chi's previous releases; their self-titled debut album and their live album, these guys are always putting out an outstanding and distinctive sound.You can tell that with each CD they release they sound better each time.This disc in my opinion, is their best to date.From the opening track 'Colonel Panic' to the final number 'Wires Tangled Up'this disc will blow you away.There's also a guest vocal by blues great Robert Cray on 'It's Nobody's Fault But Mine'.This disc has me looking forward for the next one.

He begins to see things as an Indian, and realizes that his grandmother was one of the thousands of Indian victims of greed here in Oklahoma.

I'm making a quilt and have very little to complain about. The machine is very light which is great for moving it from table to storage area, but it moves around a little more on my table. I'd rather have the lightweight feature for carrying it, though! The easy bobbin winding feature and auto needle threader are awesome!

Knowing I was having a girl is what made me buy Captivating (Wild at Heart for Women), because I want my daughter to grow up with the right messages and a healthy self-image. I was at first afraid it would be too much repeat of Wild at Hear and that I wouldn't get that much new insight out of it.It has helped me accept myself and my God-infused identity as his daughter.

Especially the olden times the setting is in. The thing that amazed me the most is the healing and the power of reading dreams. The main character is Gabriel a young boy that doesn't want to be a tough macho man he wants to be a peaceful healer. In this story some major problems are that the empress Petra has a crush on a simple healer like Gabriel. Another problem is that his uncle wants him to be a man by following his father's foot steps in honor of his death, but Gabriel has another idea by the way his life is going. I give the book 4 stars out of 5. It's a pretty good book.",1

Then, I heard what made Pink Floyd famous...Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, Meddle.The music in the Final Cut is soulless. I don't know, there is nothing there that makes you want to come back to listen to it again. It's just so bland and blahh.

Don't pay the 9 or 10 dollars it's going to cost you to get in (unless you're old like me which would mean 'only' a 6 or 7 dollar admission). It'll keep you interested for about the first 45 minutes. After that I become distracted by the endless closeups (full-face, profile, eyes only, mouth only, top of head, hands) and pained expressions which substituted for meaningful dialogue. Frankly, my mind began to wander..wondering why Redford didn't stay out of the sun in his youth, why Dafoe's skin is beginning to look like linoleum, why there was only that one shot of the dog, why Helen Mirren would sign on for such tripe. I'm giving it 2 stars for the actor playing the detective. He was good. His assistant had one line. I'm always curious about such shenanigans.",0

4322,"Terribly disappointed with this book: I can't believe that I'm giving anything Frank Peretti had a hand in a 1-star rating. Frank Peretti is one of my favorite writers and I waited anxiously for this book to come out. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in HOUSE.The book is just plain boring and somewhat stupid at times. I understand the symbolic representations, but thought it was just too repetitive and mundane. Perhaps it was just too long.I read the book in one setting and thought about giving up on it after the first 150 pages or so, but I just knew that it HAD to get better...well, it didn't. The ending was a total let-down and was almost like an afterthought. It seems like Peretti and Dekker just said, ""All right, we're finished...end of story.""I'll continue to be a Frank Peretti fan, but I just won't recommend this Peretti book to others.",0
4323,"...: Too many awful things to say about this movie, the worst I've seen in years. Bad premise, horrible gags, offensive languange and situations, grab-bag music. Without Carrey, this wouldn't have gotten past the studio secretary's waste basket. One star is a handout. Pitiful.",0

The disappointment when I found out it wasn't live, just yet ANOTHER!!!! compilation by this band. Don't get me wrong I love Europe to bits and they have written many great albums and amazing songs over the years, buy why, why, why all of the compilations??

4331,"His and Hers Kindles: Now we can both read easily at the beach and pool, while in waiting rooms and on the plane, and even as a passenger in the car. We like the easy-to-read screen, the notes and dictionary features. The only possible flaw we see at this point is that every time you pick it up or put it down, the 'next page' buttons are too easily pressed by mistake. Needs to have a better side grip with smaller 'next page' buttons, in our opinion. Otherwise, it's terrific. And books cost less and don't pile up around the house.",1

4333,"Fell short of expectations&#65533;: I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me.",0

4335,"What Could Have Been: What a shame that the possibilities of this film never materialized. Maybe I shouldn't have watched ""March of the Penguins"" first. Obviously, that film was very enlightning, though not overly entertaining. So I sat down to watch ""Farce of the Penguins"" and was bored with it. All I could think about was ""What Could Have Been"", if they had taken a little longer to think things out; or taken a few more shots at the movie itself - something - anything to make it funny. But no, there was no laughter in our house that night - only disappointment over ""What Could Have Been"".",0
4336,great movie.: It's amazing how they get the actors lips to sync with english.I am glad someone made a movie like this as my brother was in the Koran war but spoke very little about it.

And it's not pretty. When I first read it I was most impressed with its clarity and patient explanations. Now that I've read the text twice I keep it open for the wonderful recipes in the second half of the book. I didn't think that you could make such tasty stuff without any kind of sweet fruit... but these recipes are delicious! I've been pleased and delighted with every one that I've tried.

The other disparaging reviews on this page are quite correct--particularly those of the unfortunate soul who relied on it heavily for his test preparation.

It will satisfy everyone from the hard-core historian to the layman looking for a tragic, true story. The genesis for Hood's 1864 Tennessee Campaign, the lost opportunity at Spring Hill and the bloody assault at Franklin are all covered. Maps and pictures illuminate the strategies and the action for the reader. The presentation is very balanced from the perspectives of both Federals and Confederates. I have a personal library comprised of numerous books on many Civil War campaigns and battles, and this book ranks among the very best.",1

We've had the bag for over two years and it has held up pretty well - no rips or loose seams. The shoulder strap did break on our last trip, but this was with the Pack n Play and other stuff in it, so I'm sure it exceeded the weight limit. There are handles so it's not a big deal.",1

4353,"Reads like a romance novel: The story was good, but a bit far-fetched. However, the further I got into the book, the more difficult it was to actually finish it (which I eventually did). The problem was that as the story progressed it became more and more like a trashy romance novel, making it difficult to enjoy the story itself.Unless the author can get away from her emphasis on the childish behavior of the heroine, I doubt I would ever pick up another of her books.",0

I would love to rate this CD better, but it is just so disappointing. Apart from 'Days Like This' and 'Ancient Highway' the dreadful backing vocals and utter, desperate sense of making songs just for the sake of it pervades this tedious, embarrassing album. There is precious little of any worth at all. If you are new to Van Morrison, please listen to something else, or you are likely to miss out on truly wonderful, inspiring music.",0

Hedges reiterates over and over how the USA fights against enemies we flag as evil and must be stopped, yet we are the evil ones in others' eyes. Yea no kidding, except we don't preach that all other religions must be wiped out like our enemies do. This was a huge waste, and the author's descriptions of where he's been and how many wars he's been in is so repetitive its annoying, not to mention he seems to be caught in a lie in certain spots he says he was.",0

4365,"Don't waste your money on this one: This book was a waste of my time and money. The author seems to be interested in only two things: 1) Patting himself on the back for his ""accomplishments"" and 2) Spewing as much right wing, conservative rhetoric as possible. There are many more good books on the market that discuss blogging, the Internet, etc. The author of this book seems more to be a mouthpiece for the far right wing Republican Party and big business. If you are open minded and don't like verbal bile spewing, don't buy this book.",0

4368,"Raining on the parade: author is instrusive and tiresome: After a friend reacted to the book in the exact same way as me, I decided to pass this along. Subject matter is hugely interesting, but Pickover seems most interested in himself, in his cutesy writing style, in showing off unnecessarily grandiloquent vocabulary, in categorizing and putting in boxes.... in fact, the ""subjects"" were treated just that way, as subjects. How interesting if someone like Dr. Oliver Sacks, who is interested in their humanity, might treat these folk at the far end of the continuum of human behavior. I couldn't even finish Pickover's treatment.",0

4371,"Movie based on a hoax: If this were not presented as a ""true story"", I'd rate it differently. Frank Hopkins, born in the late 1870s - early 1880s (depending on how he felt when he filled out his draft registration cards in 1918 and 1942), was a liar and a fraud. (do a little Internet research to flesh this claim out) This is a classic example of a pre-Internet ""viral rumor"" that was started by his written ""recollections"" and folks wanting to believe a fascinating story. Disney - which was warned in advance regarding this hoax - should be ashamed. Note to Jeff Shannon at Amazon.com - do the above suggested research and consider rethinking your ""based on the real-life"" characterization.",0
4372,"Pretty good if you don't mind cussing.: Of Mice and Men has an excellent plot - I didn't want to put it down once I got started. It is the story of two farmers in California in the 1930's, George and Lennie. Lennie doesn't know his own strength and consequently, it gets him a lot of trouble. The only problem I found with this book was the foul language. I was forced to read this book for school, and was shocked to discover the schooling system apparently encourages cussing, otherwise I would not have been forced to read it. A book containing murder, prositution, and extreme foul language such as that included in Of Mice and Men should, in my mind, not be a cumpulsory reading text for school. Once I learned to ignore the language problem, I found that I rather enjoyed the plot and the style in which it was written. George and Lennie's personalities are so well drawn out, it's hard to believe they are mere characters in a book of fiction. All bad content aside, Of Mice and Men was quite entertaining.",0

I bought this book in the last month. Now I understand. The publisher failed the reader (and the author--this is a second edition) by making the 'bold"" print not distinguishable enough from the regular print, making it a frustrating chore to try to follow the narrative of the life of Christ. I showed it to my 33-year-old son tonight to get his opinion, since he has younger eyes. He too had the same problem. Sad.

My Phillips head screwdriver (#1) didn't unscrew anything, one of the files broke when I tried to use it, and I can't seem to effect much of a change on any of my reeds besides snapping them off, which I've now done four times (ouch!).

4393,"Magicimage Filmbooks Presents Abbott and Costello Meet Frank: This is a great treasure for Abbott and Costello fans as well as Chaney, Lugosi, or Universal fans. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book. The script is still titled ""The Brain of Frankenstein"" and includes deleted scenes which further add to the story. As someone who has seen the film many times the added info gives new insights as to the characters performances.",1
4394,"A spectacular growing up book: This was one of my favorite childhood books. No, it's no longer the right thing to do to buy a child a puppy as a birthday present, but barring that out of date idea, the book is a timeless classic. It's one children enjoy having read to them again and again. I'll always remember Bitsy's beds. Highly recommended.",1

I don't like it that he only comes with 2 lightsabers when he usually has 4 (2 green and 2 blue that he took after killing 4 Jedi). The legs are exposed when in packaging.

4399,"What would you do if you were faced with a murderer, sober or drugged.: I think that this young girl was a very brave person, and who are we to judge what she was or who she is going to be. I followed the incident all the way and the book is a true story and she shows a lot of courage. She was faced with this murderous man and I believe she was led through the whole ordeal by God. Our Lord is a passionate and kind God. He loves us all, so please give her a chance and love her like God does. Her life hasn't been too good and some of it at her own choosing, but it seems she is about to turn her life around. Her actions paid off and I'm glad she was offered these book deals, etc., everyone else gets them. We need to pray for her instead of judging her.",1
4400,"A movie that grows on you - like an addiction: I watched this over the space of three or four nights. Thought it was a little slow and disjointed at first - couldn't see where it was going. Then, little by little, layer by layer, fragment by fragment, the horror and the madness began to unfold. I was - and still am - hooked. Haunting, erotic, subtle and unpredictable, Habit is a minor masterpiece that belongs right up there with the best of the modern vampire genre.",1

Avery brand labels print perfectly and are easy to straighten and stack, which is really helpful if you do hundreds of labels at a time like I do. Laser printer labels work fine on my HP Officejet Pro 8600.Amazon sells these for a third less than at Staples, which saves a lot of money too.

4409,"Cyndi is still great, but this album was very disappointing.: My husband and I are big Cyndi Lauper fans so we purchased this album with high expectations. Alas, we must agree with Jason's view . . . somehow, someone coerced Cyndi into producing this album. The songs are indeed old but we thought if anyone could do them justice, it would be Cyndi Lauper. However, she sings them almost as if she's being forced to do so -- without any true feeling. There's no spark . . . she just trudges through the songs. This album was so bad that we ended up selling it at a garage sale and, trust me, it takes a lot for us to get rid of an album.",0
4410,Great product. Total VFM.: This microphone does its job very well. The background noise is very low-unless you adjust your headphones volume to be very high you will be hard-pressed to notice the noise.

I do not have to be louder than usual- my voice is crystal clear and even if I speak softly I can be heard clearly.,1

Edward Norton act like a weak, coward guy and he look very sick, Brad Pitt act like a macho brat, I find more tolerable the acting performance of Norton then Pitt. Norton was much better in the movie ""American History X"", I think he should stick to theses kind of roles and loose the weak one who make him look like a coward. You may like this movie if you like lots of violence, lots of blood and a boring story. At the end the movie make more sence, well a little bit but it's still very boring and another ""Clich칠 American Movie"" that people will say it's cool because big names are in it, well even if ""Movie Stars"" are in a boring movie it's doesn't make the movie great, well not to me!",0

But it is a beautiful song.I believe those buying this album will enjoy it. There are plenty of well known standards and Charlotte does a good job with all. I believe that she is not that far away from a 5-star album. I wonder what this album is a prelude to?????",1
4413,"Nice pop-up for kids or collectors: This 20-page (10 layouts with 10 ""pop ups"") book has a question on the left page and the movable piece that reveals the answer on the right. Topics are bug based and include Santa Bug, stocking, wreath, mistletoe, tree, etc. This is not like current pop-up books that have a major event with the turn of a page. These require the reader's manipulation: many pieces move flatly on the page (with a tab pull), some you unfold to reveal the pop up. While this may not dazzle as much initially, it does make it fun for kids as you read the question and they await the movement and answer. And this may mean they can turn the pages because it doesn't require as much care (as, say, a Sabuda pop up). Also, it might not get as destroyed by young, not-so careful readers.Two notes:My copy has a few pages where the tabs are a bit stiff.The last page, which has a light and music, requires the tab to be pushed back in to turn it off (if this isn't done, the battery will wear down).",1

It has a great hero, who thinks circles around his enemys: Bellarion is the brilliant boy raised in a monastary, who is always the chivalrous gentlemen, protects ladies and always does what is right. The whole book keeps you guessing at the plot, and is very well written. I have read several other books by this other and so far this is my favorite. It is my present favorite book right now, up there with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Freckles"". This is not a quick read;it is a story you will want to savor. I highly recommend this book!",1

And as to following the book, remember, this movie is ""Scrooge"", not ""A Christmas Carol"". It's as well done as any movie can be and will fulfill your holiday's with it's excellence. Albert Finney is excellent in his portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge, and he gives credence to what I consider the original, Lionel Barrymore who gave us ""A Christmas Carol"" on four 78 records in the 40's. There are many Christmas stories, and this one rates #1 on my list. Unlike so many movies of today, this one will leave you feeling happy as it ends....",1

4427,"Part 3 Little Pigs, part Red Riding Hood: Part Red-Riding Hood and part The Three Little Pigs with a Chinese twist. Three little girls are left at home while their mother goes to visit their grandmother on her birthday. The mother tells her daughters to latch the door once she leaves and not to let anyone in. An old wolf sees the mother leave and tries to trick the girls into letting him into their house. He tells them he is their grandmother and while the two younger girls belive him, the oldest one is wary. They let him in, but the oldest girl realizes he's a wolf and so she convinces her sisters and they come up with a plan to trick the wolf.I give it 4 out of 5 stars mostly for the artwork. Very beautiful pastels and realistic wolf, yet impressionistic at the same time. The story was an interesting version of the western tale of Little Red-Riding Hood, but it may be scary and/or sad to some children (technically the same could be said about the western Red-Riding Hood story).",1

But wait, even if I had come across this book when I'm, like, 20+, I would still be able to laugh,cry,etc. along with it. It's really fun to read (although there are parts that I can't understand, like Bee's ""disappointment""), but manages to be quite heavy (I've never really had problems like their's, but it made me realize that it's up to you to make your life miserable or not, by the way you handle your problems) at times. It doesn't disappoint, although I wish they already have the sequel in bookstores here, or else I would persuade my mom to get one from Amazon! Anyway, just encouraging you to read it, coz there's a really big possibility you're gonna enjoy it like I do! 칖",1

Hope they write a second book on more topics. Or concentrate in a single one, like education. I found some of the conclusions in this field very shocking and interesting.",1

Transmitter is small, light, and fits the hot shoe on my SLR.Though one really needs little in terms of instructions, I would have liked more information about battery life, especially for the receivers, which have no switch. The dealer was so confident about the long life of the 24v transmitter battery that they didn't even stock replacements. I think I will try to find a backup battery anyway.The ""keyhole"" slot for the attachment fixture on the receiver seems to have been designed upside down. It hasn't yet proved a problem, but I would have more confidence had it been designed to allow the weight of the unit to secure the holder in the keyway of the receiver.Best thing so far is that it works, and battery drain on the AAA's seems minimal.",1

Who knows...Anyway, after I thoroughly cleaned the balls, I decided to see how they handle. Balance wasn't bad, and the balls appeared to be evenly weighted. The real problem was durability. These balls have to be handled pretty delicately, and really - who does that? After a few drops, one of the balls was already starting to show some wear.

She must have gotten some younger helpers because much to my delight the Sean Jean store and and Triple Five Soul shop are mentioned too. One thing I've always liked about the Born to Shop series is that the advice shows you how to get around town safely, how to buy quality and how to have a good time with as few hassles as possible.

Especially after a long days work, etc. I have a 38lb. black Spanador (Cocker Spaniel and Lab mix). This breed is high energy and needs to be active much of the time. She is also a CHEWER! I do not recommend this ball for really any dog. No matter if the dog is high or low energy or chews/not chews. In my experience the ball made her more 'spastic' and crazy. I believe it was overstimulating her in a negative way. Also, the ball started to break apart in little pieces after only a few hours. I do not recommend this product. Maybe if the manufacture rubberized it in the tough material that Kongs and other durable products are made out of. I found that walks and fetch still prove to be her favorite past times.

I have read probably thousands of books, but if I had to choose between all the books in the world and the Herald Mage Trilogy, I would choose the Trilogy. All I can say is GET THE BOOKS. You will never again think the same of horses, or magic. It really all makes logical sense about the way magic and people used to work together. I'm going to shut up now before I go read the books another 20 times without stopping. Mercedes Lakey is and will always be the best writer in my world.",1

4467,"We'll always have Gatchaman - we hope: Much has been made about the complete lack of remastering of the Battle of the Planets episodes, but I believe a great many fans buying these DVDs are in agreement: the original Japanese Gatchaman episodes are the real gold of the Battle of the Planets DVDs. There's a definite story arc that can be followed, the characterizations are sharper, and - owing to a recent series of Gatchaman DVD releases in Japan - the original Japanese episodes ARE remastered quite nicely. As of volume 3, the ""trading cards"" disappeared from each disc's bonus material, so make sure to let Rhino Home Video know that you want to keep seeing the original Gatchaman episodes alongside those Battle of the Planets episodes we all grew up with.",1
4468,"Meh...: The poster says,""Refreshingly original"".This is false.While still having some creepy moments in it that kept the movie mildly entertaining, very little of this feature has originality.The flick is pretty much the bastard love child of 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Rosemarys baby'.I will admit that I was enjoying it untill the half assed shamalan-esque twist at the end. When that came about, I couldn't stop laughing. All I could think of was a bunch of old people sipping wine in a parlor room saying in bright friendly voices,""hail Satan!"", and I lost it.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over 14 years old.TL;DR: If you can drive a car, smoke a cigarette, or drink a beer legally.

4469,"The Most Beautiful Production: It's been a long time since I read the book and I think this film takes some liberties with it, but I don't care. I enjoyed it purely as a ""doomed love"" story. I liked this better than any other version of Anna Karenina that I have seen, primarly because of the beautiful cinematography, the glorious music, the extravagantly beautiful interiors and the presence of Sean Bean, who has to be the sexiest Vronsky of all time. Sophie Marceau was not a bad Anna and at least, unlike some versions I have seen, it wasn't hard to see why she would inspire Vronsky's obsession. And the ballroom scene was one of the most beautiful and sweepingly romantic I have ever seen. There was a little too much of the Kitty/Levin relationship and Levin's voiceover ramblings were at points pretty boring but the movie overall is really a jewel in every way--very romantic, two beautiful protagonists, exotic settings and a score second to none.",1

The other reviews are correct - it's not capable of recreating ""Metal Zone"" type sounds. Thus, don't be fooled by the death metal looks - it's more of a classic rock sound. Full analog sound - warm, not harsh.The names of the knobs take some getting used to. I realize they were going for a theme here, but I would have appreciated ""Volume, Drive, and Tone."" But that's picky stuff. You get a pedal for the sound, and if you're looking for a overdrivew with a warm yet ballsy sound, this might be your pedal.To top it all off, they're going for $50 and less nowadays, so the value is definitely there.

But when the culprit was finally revealed, I was left with a huge HUH?There weren't enough clues in the book to make you connect the killer to the crime. Because of that, the book didn't really come together nicely for me and was a waste of time as I had carefully followed all the subplots and paid attention as I usually do in a mystery book.Sue Grafton really got into a lot of lewd descriptive sex scenes in the book, which was more I have noticed in other books in the series.

Sadly, the sound of thumping and glass breaking represents basically the rest of the CD.Don't Stay comes next.

4488,"Great headset: I bought the LTB MG-AC97 to replace my Microsoft LX3000 unit, which became inoperative. Both units were fairly comfortable, but not for long hours of gaming. Fortunately, I was able to transfer the David Clark liquid-filled cushions, which I had bought for the MS headset, directly over to the LTB. This adds that 5th star, but LTB didn't add it, I did.Being able to tell where the threat is coming from, in a game like Far Cry 2, for example, is very valuable, and LTB's 5.1 surround sound set-up does just that. I was concerned that the lack of a boom, for the mic. might be a problem, but my fellow gamer, (wife), hears me 5 by 5, when we play WOW, or HGL.One minor glitch, probably unique to my particular set-up, is that a line-spike, from the switch on my desk-lamp will knock out my headset audio, but usually, I can click the volume buttons a bit, and it will come back.

As one surprisingly honest reporter put it, ""He was not very intelligent, nor was he either well travelled or well read. He picked his nose during the interviews."" So much for Ted Bundy in real time. Writing a 420 pg novel with a cockaroach running amok as the main character was certainly a challenge, but Michael Perry fufilled it very well.

For anyone who's ever read the Hitchhiker's books, you'll understand that the plot is nothing worth writing home about.BTW, I feel sad for the narrator, who apparently was never told that he was narrating a comedy.

4518,"Lady was Lousy: All I can say is don't bother. The story of Lady Emma was flighty, stupid and predictable. Pro golf, bad-boy, Kenny Traveler was SEP's typical rich, handsome, strong airhead who needed a hammer over the head to realize the love he felt for a good woman, however, ""Lady E"" was more like a dingbat to my mind. The most structured characters in this story were Torie and Dex and even their drama was a little ridiculous to the point of over-the-edge nonsense. This is the typical, boy meets girl through circumstances, girl falls for boy, who by the way is totally clueless to her attraction to him, girl acts amazingly stupid, then boy declares his love for this stupid girl. I think I need to take a break from SEP. Her characters are duplicating themselves with different names and different stories, but basically the same old, same old actions.

I work an 8-5 job and talk on the phone maybe 90 minutes of the day, and starting out, the headset would keep it's charge until midway through the 2nd day (nowhere near the 100 hour standby and 6 hour talk time mentioned in the product description). Then it started only lasting until around 3pm the first day after it had been charged, so I had to charge it up every day when I got home. Now, after owning it about 6 weeks, I can't even get it to hold a charge past noon - less than 45 minutes of talk time maximum. When I did charge it, I would hook it up to charge overnight before the days I would work, so maybe that fried the battery memory, but you would think it wouldn't change it that much in just 6 weeks.

Have you ever heard of a manufacturer who would have you do that?",0
4532,"Think twice about this movie!: Anyone who's read the book will be profoundly disappointed with this movie because all the significant issues [e.g., the reason for Philippa's avoidance of Elspeth (sister Cecily in the book, Sr. Joanna in the movie); the relationship with Elspeth & the choir director--forgot this sister's name, etc) never happen in the movie. It's unbelievable that all these incidents were left out & the movie hooked (not wove!) tiny pieces of some incidents without giving any relationship or connection to the characters. A fabulous story which would've been an epic movie was ruined to become absolutely NOTHING!! I'm sorry I bought it & glad I didn't pay $45 or so for it. What a waste of good acting by a very good cast, but even they couldn't save a movie which really has no story whatsoever!",0
4533,"saves color: This product is easy on my rather dry scalp and it is good for saving the color of your hair. I don't use it every time, I alternate, because while it is alright for hair texture, it isn't perfect for my hair, and my curly hair seems to do better alternating. It is still much better than many brands I have tried, though, so I give it a 4 star.",1

4535,"Heading uphill again: Finally Fugazi has released an album which is better than the previous one, after hitting bottom with Red Medicine. End Hits contains just enough gritty hooks and shout-alongs to make the discordant interludes tense instead of wanky (""Break"", ""Caustic Acrostic""), and their patented chunks of controlled feedback return in great form (""Floating Boy""). If I were new to Fugazi I'd get Repeater first, or maybe 13 Songs: if you're an ex-fan wondering whether they were ever going to stop sucking, go ahead and buy it.",1

4538,"The BEST Concept Album In Her Career: I don't care what any other so-called ""Mariah fans"" say - this is her best conceptual album to date (even though my personal favorite is ""Music Box""). Here, Mariah shows us that she can go into the R&B realm and still come out with something that's hot. Like ""Babydoll"", ""Breakdown"", ""The Roof"", ""The Beautiful Ones"" (w/ Dru Hill). I'm really disappointed that the record company didn't release ""Breakdown"" commercially. That was one hot single (in my opinion). This album was like Mariah's declaration of independence - this is where she broke from her long time musical collaborations w/ walter afanasieff as well as her (now ex) husband tommy mottola. this is where she broke through the pop-balladeer glass ceiling and began to spread her wings to fly. For this screaming declaration of independence (and solid songs from start to finish), i want to give her 10 STARS!!!",1

They need to get some hip hop viagra.",0
4540,"I remember: As a student at The University of Chicago in the 1970's this book brought back fond, and accurate memories of the late Allan Bloom. Bellow does a great job of capturing the force of Bloom's personality, his cult following, his eccentric nature, and his incredible intellect. The book inspires me to re read Bloom's best selling, ""The closing of the American mind."" Bellow succeeds then, he not only honors his friend, but does exactly what Bloom would have wanted -- calling those of us who were his students back, and inspiring us to keep learning.",1
4541,"SUPERFICIAL AT BEST: Nice visually but superficial. Parading the usual Hollywood values""Sleeping around is a positive thing"". ""self centeredness"" also very positive. Funnily enough the funeral was the best part of the movie and john Hannah's eulogy the highpoint of the film. I like Andie MacDowell But her role was pretty much confined to looking pretty and sensitive. Hugh Grant just bumbled. I am not sure it deserves even a 2.",0

It's impossible to describe this film that juxtaposes Pirates World, Thumbelina, Santa, AND an Ice Cream Bunny (whatever that it).

4544,"Still Smokin' after all these years!: This is the album for a new listener to start with as an introduction to Los Lobos. Los Lobos' music blends blues, zydeco, rock, & norteno into a rich melting pot of sounds! This album doesn't mess around - it roars off with the bluesy ""Don't Worry Baby."" Cesar Rosas powers it with strong vocals & guitar riffs! It also has beautiful ballads by David Hidalgo such as ""A Matter of Time."" The soft & stringly ""Lil King of Everything"" leads into their great classic ""Will The Wolf Survive."" Los Lobos' music has something for everybody! Since it's release in 1984, this albums remains one of my top favorites! I highly recommend it!",1

There were no chapters or setup links. Even the Warner Archive DVDs are better than this. It played fine & the quality was passable, considering the movie's age.I've never bought an illegal copy of anything. Is this how they look? It makes me uneasy to own it.",0

4548,Horrible.: This book is a total let down. It is so unlike Crichton to produce such trash. He gets so technical that I'm certain this book would appeal more to an aircraft enthusiast than it would a lay person. I really hope he produces better stuff in time to come.,0
4549,Great easy to follow recommendations: This book has clear easy to follow recommendations on the healthiest foods for you. It also has alternate recommendations in case you just can't stand one of the recommended foods.

4550,Music for your soul: Spiritual War is music for the soul of every person. I want to say thanks to Navasha and her outstanding talented musicans. I am addicted to the sound of the music and the words mean so much. Who would have ever thought music could actually be written to mean something these days. My soul bleeds for this type of music.,1
4551,Memories of an Ex Prom Queen: This was not my favourite book! The story drifted along sometimes without a point and the heroine seemed cynical and disallusioned about life.

4552,"best to read the WHOLE book: My parents first sent me on my own to visit my paternal grandparents in Swabia when I was nine years old. I was so excited to find a book about the place that I'd visited every few years during my youth. I read this book several years back but would very much like to read it again (whoever I lent it to, please return it!!). I do recall that the attitude of the author transforms (about many, though not all things) from the beginning of the book to the end, and therefore you should commit to reading the whole book before you start it. I'll write more someday - after I've had a chance to read it again!",1

What hand plane!: Product description declare: ""woodworkers have been left without any moderately priced choice between the construction of contemporary Stanley planes and the price of premium tools like Cliftons or Lie-Nielsens"".Woodworkers? I just cannot imagine that any woodworker professional or hobbyist will use this so called ""hand plane"". Chip-breaker and iron are totally useless; you are not going to be able to restore them. Sole is total mess; you will need at least 0.03-0.05"" cutting/lapping of the entire sole to flatten it. Are you really ready for such job? Frog is also not flat. And finally this is not BedRock design.Altogether, purchase of the plane was waste of the money. Companies like Anant rely on novices (I was too) that would like to buy a bargain. Well, is it? Question is ""why does Highland Woodworker sell this cr*p?""",0

The first time through was great - we especially enjoyed the fact that after a point, all players could jump in on the ""wedge"" questions. HOWEVER, we did see shades of the problem that would become truly TIRESOME by the second time we played it - the repetition of the questions on the DVD. Honestly, by the second time we played it, there were so many questions we'd seen before that we never even finished the game and swore to never play it again. I am in the process of returning it to Hasbro.",0

Quite a lot of the first bit was spent on stretching warmups like touching the toes (interminable!), seems like at least half the video consisted of confrontational warmups which were prelude to Tomiki style aikido competition kata.

4558,"Best Ministry Training I've Come Across: I've been in Church my whole life, Private School, Calling and Ministries classes, and have yet to come across anything like this. This is by far the best training course in evangelism I've come across. Growing up in a Pentecostal Church where everything tends to be focused on the manifestation within the Church(for some Churches), this book opens your eyes and plants an urgency in your spirit for winning the lost. The greatest evidence of a Spirit-filled Believer, in my opinion after reading many of these lessons, is an overwhelming desire to witness to the lost. Thank God for the manifestations, the gifts and the anointing, but what good are they if we keep them in the church building? Thank God for this course. If you want your ministry to go to the next level, don't hesitate. Get this book - NOW!!",1

4563,"Nasty chemical smell: This filter gave off a nasty chemical odor. It seems to come from the rubber material around the HEPA filter and upset my allergies. I am sure that not all of them have this issue, but mine sure did! Quality control is not what it used to be I guess...And it was also way too loud! It was not at all quiet on Low, and on Medium I would have to jack up the volume of the TV. They chose to put the word ""quiet"" in the products name, it is not even close.Returning it to Amazon was easy, no issues. I have since purchased a Winix 5300 from Amazon and have been very happy with it. It has more advanced features then the Honeywell and is QUIET on low while still moving a lot of air!!!

I paid nearly $30 for a self-published booklet with less information than what is available over the Internet or looking at my own mortgage papers. Forty-one pages of large type, in mostly outline format, that could have easily fit on half that many pages. The only illustrations are of tax forms that are available at almost any library or govt office. I bet you can probably download them from the IRS website as well.

4565,"Holds up: Sinclair Lewis created an immediately-controversial character with Elmer Gantry. And while Gantry may be deeply rooted within 1920s America, he remains as sadly relevant, topical, and controversial in America, 2000, as he did in America, 1927. It's quite interesting to think that this book might have seemed quaint and dated in the 1970's. But so much has changed in our politics and regard toward the role religion plays within our everyday lives since that time, that this book could have been written today, acting as a parable or a mirror of our current culture. Gantry is a despicable character in American letters. He is uncultured, crude, hypocritical, power-hungry, and cruel in almost all of his most intimate and personal relationships (with the possible exception of his mother). Yet his shallow charisma ultimately serves him well. Lewis holds up a damning portrayal of contemporary American life, as well as the ugly side of American ambition and character.",1

And for [the price] I would expect more from the product. I have bought a new tape called WIDE BOY from SNS Tapes, now this one takes a fall from 20 feet and they hit 10'6"" to 11' everytime. And that is not on the 35 degree angle needed to get the FAT MAX to hit 10Feet. One other thing that makes it better is the WIDE BOY fits in the tape hold on my tool belt. It is also [less expensive] and comes with a utility knife I give this one a five star! So sorry STANLEY your not the best tape out there anymore.",0

It's impossible to jump holes with any character but Raistlin, and Goldmoon, a female character, even gives the same grunt as the males when she is hurt. Characters not in battle still take damage. The doors don't line up with one another or with the compass, so map-making is nearly impossible.The fantasy party of adventurers is pretty cool, and you'll probably still enjoy this one if you've read the book. Otherwise, it's a real stinker.",0

When I finally got around to tackling the book, I found myself putting it away after several hundred pages. Various sections struck me as entirely too lurid.

4580,"DO NOT READ!: The Pearl, by John Steinbeck,was a book I decided to read after a friend told me about it. It was fairly short and didn't hold any meaning. I truly think that this was Steinbeck's idea of Indians' poverty due to white man rather than a great idea for a novel. He used the two different societies and the doctor's greed to show how the white man tore the Indians apart. I think he chose a pearl as the jewel to be found because it is pretty close to white in color. The evil pearl buyers were also implied to be white people trying to kill Kino and his family for the pearl. The basic storyline could have been a descent novel had Steinbeck not thrown in all the other stuff. I would not recommend this book to anyone due to the content implied on the white man. If you must read this book, get it over quickly (you could probably finish in a day or so) and read The Count of Monte Cristo.",0

Not one person, at all? Is there proof? It only takes one case to prove this wrong, and to assume that no one, absolutely without a doubt that no one, was burned in Salem is far-fetched. Just because the statement was printed in a history book does not mean it is fact - true for most cases, yes, but not 100% right. Anyone who has taken a math class on this type of theory, making an over-reaching assumption such as this, better have some damn good proof to back it up. That being said, her book is great and very thought-provoking. Please don't be deterred by skeptics grabbing at such a stupid reason to criticize her book, due to a supposed historical fallacy that is very questionable.",1

The 'plague' referred to in a previous review is the biological mechanism that allows the human inhabitants of the planet to survive the massive temperature extremes that occur over the 'year' (1000 earth years). The temperature ranges from sub-sub arctic to ultra-tropical and the physical changes as the people go from short fat and conservative Winter people to tall thin active Summer people are described with marvellous detail.The story of the humans and their interaction with the natives of the planet is interwoven with the technical information with a masterful flair.This series is similar in breadth and vision to the Eden series by Harry Harrison, so if you enjoy one, you will love the other.",1

I have never been disappointed with Bosch's products and this one is no exception. I got this sander to sand down a 35' boat that had over 40 years of paint buildup. This sander is great and really removes the material. The only problem is 40 grit discs (paint removal) seam to be hard to find in good quality. I would like to find some Silicone Carbide discs for it, for a really sharp cutting edge to power through hard paint, but can't find any.",1

4601,"...As essential as her albums: Many would regard Joan As Police Woman's Real Life album (2006) to be her debut. But this little self-titled EP proves otherwise. According to her, these 5 tracks (plus one ""bonus"" track) are what led to her inevitable label signing. If you're a fan of Joan Wasser's records, this EP is equally outstanding to 2008's To Survive, and Real Life. But it's altogether a different beast than her two albums. Heavy wurlitzer's collide orgasmically with indie-Interpol-guitar rock stylings, and it helps that most everything Joan delivers is brilliant.There's no denying the energy of this mini-album is similar to PJ Harvey's New York inspired ""Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea,"" and that's a huge and well-deserved compliment. Joan is quite a musical force to be reckoned with. Too bad this EP is so expensive (UK only) but it's worth every cent, if at least to complete the unfolding Joan As Police Woman story, thus far.",1

4607,"sad but true: Morrison's novel may be dramatic in the approach of this issue in recent readers' eyes because in today's society, but it is true that during the time that the novel was written that many young girls went through the issues described in this novel. The issues presented in the novel are presented both eloquently and accurately. I have noticed that some people believe that Morrrison is soley blaming white americans for the problems that the main character is experiencing, but in my opinion that is not the case. I believe she is advidly pointing out the idea that society has deemed more superior. This is a fault of both blacks and whites in society. So I do not feel that anyone should be offended by the author's words because they do not lay blame upon one race of people, but with society as a whole. On a different note I feel that the novel is very well written and the characters really reach the heart of the readers.",1

For those of us who truly enjoy a very well written book that one has to take the time to read and enjoy,not just rush through for the sake of reading a book, this was one of those books. I found myself reading slowly to enjoy the book longer and loving the way it was written.The story about maddness and being a lunatic in that time period was eye-opening and at times sad and overwhelming to think about. You will feel for the situation of all the parties in the book and the struggles they had to endure.This is a book with lots of history and details written into it so you could feel the fustrations and maddness at times in the situations, maybe Greg Hollingshead had that in mind and those that felt it the most didn't like the effort needed to read the book.",1

4625,"quick, quiet steam: I read a ton of reviews before I bought this, and I don't understand how this humidifier could get a negative review. I saw that many people said it leaks, so I started it up with a towel under it, but there is no need. It doesn't leak at all. It certainly isn't loud; in fact, it is the quietest one I've ever heard. It produces steam very quickly, and the room becomes humid within one or two hours. Perhaps the people who were having trouble getting it to keep a room at a certain humidity aren't closing doors and windows completely? I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a room to stay at greater than 45% or 50% while the heat is on. It just isn't possible when it is cold outside. It is very easy to disassemble, clean, and reassemble. I have had it for more than a month, and I'm very impressed so far.A word to those who are heat-sensitive: it will heat up the room. I think it heats it up enough that you can turn down your heat and save on heating bills.",1

4628,MIND WALK IS TOO GOOD FOR MOST OF US!: Mind Walk is not quite as good as My Dinner With Andre but it is still very good. The three main characters are played by wonderful actors which makes the movie even more interesting. This movie is for people who like to think and ponder about the mysterious world we live in. It is an adventure for the mind and spirit. It is definitely in my library and one that I watch often.,1

4630,"Painfully tedious: The author is fond of describing pain and suffering in excruciating detail. Well, that is nothing compared to what you will endure if you try to read this. It is one thing to instill moral, ethical, political, and economic beliefs and values into a story but it is unbearable and unacceptable to wade through this brutal repetition, and redundancy. I feel like the same basic concept has been rehashed half a hundred times from every possible combination of possible outcomes and perspectives.Spare yourselves. If you want a book on ethical decision making...buy one, there are lots of good ones out there. If you want to read about what comprises a freely governed society consider reading the Federalist Papers. If you want to read good fantasy, stick with the earlier books or look elsewhere.",0

If you don't like blood, why did you pay to see this movie in the first place? And so what if it isn't ""historically accurate""!?! I wish I could record just so you could hear how sarcastic my voice is. A lot of movies aren't historically accurate. It didn't stop this one from being one of the best films I've ever seen. This was a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson was amazing as William Wallace. Everybody should see this movie. His aura is so rich you can feel what he feels, and that makes this experience even better.",1

4634,"Bea Lydecker's ""Seasons"": I ""met"" Bea Lydecker online in (I think) a healing-related Internet forum in the early 2000s. For a religion-oriented person this book may be appealing, but her frequent reference to ""God this, God that, God-God-God,"" is distracting to me, so I did not read very far into it. I would gladly DUMP the book at a resale site, only they're SO cheap (often under a dollar - see Amazon's ""Marketplace"" list) that it's not worth the bother to package and ship it. I can just give it away instead, to one of my 'religion' neighbors - they may be delighted with it.No offense to the religion-oriented folks anywhere. My mother was an atheist: Roman Catholic-raised, (terrorized/abused) drop-out/runaway, so we did not get the religion-indoctrination in our home -or- the god-programming routine that seems to compose so much of our species' ""permitted"" (trained) ""belief"" systems.",0

What's up with that? The acting/dialogue was horrible; its obvious that Lucas tried to make that up with all the fancy computerized scenes in the movie. They picked the wrong actors to play Anakin and Padme. I had to buy the spanish dubbed VHS of Attack of the Clones because i couldnt stand Hayden's acting. The only thing good about Episode III is the scene where Darth Vader is introduced. I pray that the TV series is worth watching.",0

The meditations it teaches are simple yet powerful, and I believe they can improve how people feel about themselves, and operate in the world.I bought this book several years ago, and still turn to it regularly to review the principles and practices it describes.

With each month covering ideas to inspire you to make a change, stir things up, get out of your routine - it even has recipes apropos for each month. So far I've enjoyed the book - I even love the cover design! I think it would make an excellent gift or even excellent for a group of friends to do month to month and enjoy together.I'm not so sure that the title does it justice, it could just as well be called, ""Organize, Enjoy and Beautify your life and try something new for yourself and others while getting yourself out of the doldrums of the everyday routine."" but I guess that would've taken up too much space on the cover.",1

The old Auster themes of boyhood and fatherhood are dealt with beautifully, and the fact that its a retelling from an insiders point of view darkens the entire novel.

And the tray, tool holder and papertowel rack work very well. Everyone wants to use my step stool now - in fact I just bought a second one for work use. I like it that well. Worth every penny, and the safest and most comfortable step stool around. It is a bit on the heavy side for me (a lady) to carry any distance, but I can carry it with both hands. I still know this is the best product and worth the cost.",1
4675,"Cardiac Arrest is not a novel: I am a huge Richard Laymon fan but Cardiac Arrest is undoubtably the worst book that I have ever purchased from Amazon. They do not tell you that this supposed book is more pamplet size and is only 28 pages long. It took about 10 minutes to read the entire book. Also, it does not even resemble any of the other Laymon books that I have read. Unless you are wanting to spend 7 or 8 dollars for a ten minute read, I would pass this ""book"" up.",0
4676,"Less charge time, less mess, more capability, and more vacuum power!!: Being that my previous Norelco trimmer (a T770) took 10 hours to fully charge, I greatly liked how the T980 took just 70 minutes to do the same thing. And I just LOVE the mini-beard trimmer attachment!! Now I can trim my beard line, mustache and sideburn hair (with the help of vacuum power) without having to worry about a HUGE mess to clean up!! And the turbo power option? The 30% increase in vacuum power it provides helps out in situations where you have to hold the T980 in contorted, odd positions to get the job done (i.e. upside down), and you don't want hair that's being cut coming out of the device.In short, the Norelco T980 is a BIG improvement over the trimmer that I used to have!! And the price was pretty damn reasonable, too!! I definitely feel that I got my money's worth when I purchased this product!!",1

My friend drug me to it saying it was going to be terrifying, and I wound up rolling my eyes through the whole thing. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't claim it was real but from the opening scene it was VERY obvious it was completely fake so it was hard to like.- Not scary what-so-ever- Horrible acting- Common story plot- If you go into it thinking its real, its a major let-down.But if you like alien movies, this is for you.

4688,Wonderful Book: What a wonderful book. A wonderful body of knowledge and wisdom for the uncompromising eyes may seems to be right for its time but is truly a treaty for all the times. Each essay contains the cost of a life time. Full of interesting stories and a big deal of searching lights.,1
4689,"Fun, but a third person voice: Peggy's story is definitely a fun read, if not a fun life in itself. It reminds us of how secondary money can be to finding true love. She was the product of a wild time in history and this book, while well-written, makes me want to read her story in her own hand. A good ""map to the stars"" if you're interested in some gossip on the artists of the period. I paid next to nothing for the book - if I had paid full price, I might have felt a little less satisfied.",1

This is a great reference book.",1

I've been a Rozan fan for years -- love the alternating-voice thing -- and I have to say this book shows simultaneously a lyricism and a toughness beyond even what Rozan has given us before. Characters are real, setting so believeable you can feel the chill in the air. Highly recommended.",1
4692,Good but surprised: I bought this press for a family member who lives in Africa who often does not have electricity to run the coffeemaker. He will be able to use this when he can only heat water by gas. He says it works well but he was surprised that he could only get 2 mugs of coffee on one brew because of the amount of foam that seems to build when you add the water. I don't have any experience with coffee presses but maybe this info will help someone else.,1

The largest screwdriver on this set is a T10 and it goes down to T5 (which is quite small). I have sinced used these screwdrivers to repair a signal switch on my VW Golf and take my Xbox 360 apart (more than once). So far, they appear to be holding up well - no rounding of the corners observed.I especially like the fact that the end of the screwdriver that sits in your palm rotates freely so it is very easy to apply some pressure with your palm and then spin the screwdriver with your fingers - very nice feature. The case is a little cheaply made but the price is right so I can't really complain. If you are looking for a mini-torx set, this one will work nicely.",1

Also, it is almost impossible to find anything in the horrible index; it was a though they didn't want you to locate their recipes. In short, a mammoth disappointment.",0

The only difference between the two is that one is just as bad as the other.If you are looking for something similar to Enigma, I suggest you try Amethystium. They do sound a little different to Enigma and are not as good but they are closer to Enigma than Lesiem.",0

Jorgensen connects climate, geology and ecology through the concept of ecological communities in a comprehensive but simple to understand way.

This book has very few but that should not be viewed as a shortcoming as the insight and originality of the observations is outstanding. The book is out of print and this is a shame as it would be an excellent introductory textbook to field ecology and native plants classes.",1

It grows and matures with every listen.If you buy this album I would caution you against associating it with any particular person or relationship, as you'll have to put it away for good if that relationship ends. Trust me on this one. It's that potent.Damien is, frankly, not to be missed, even if he breaks your heart.",1

I had just received my much anticipated pre-ordered copy and finished watching this new show. I still like the guys, nice and easy on the eye, but this time I think there's something seriously amiss, probably the material they chose to perform which didn't go well with their style. If I didn't see them before then I'd definitely say this is a very average group and doesn't deserve the attention they get.",0

The movie was horrible to be honest, the story is good, but the movie is boring. Maybe if they only changed the location and raise the suspense a little, then it would have been a great success.",0
4716,"A little less than excellent.... but highly recommendable.: Well, perhaps I should have to grant it a plain full five stars.But... there's always some little nuances that keeps one from giving the highest rating.In this particular case is the vocalist. In my opinion Leonardo Sasso exceeds in the use of harsh tones and appears a little bit strong over a well balanced music ensemble. I don't want to mean that he is a bad singer. Not at all... but perhaps his voice or his vocal techniques aren't the best for the kind of music they compose. Pay good attention to the last (bonus) track called New York: backing vocals and choirs give it the soft quiet mood that some other songs lack.Nevertheless this album is an excellent work, a music masterpiece that by any means runs second to PFM, Banco, or any other italian prog rock talent. In fact, during instrumental passages, anyone can believe it is one of those great bands. Try it, you'll not be dissappointed at all.",1
4717,"Pathetic Copycat Movie.: This movie is pathetic, not only does it completely change the very nature of anne, But it even has the nerve to steal plot points from other stories and claim them as there own.For instance when Anne goes to live at the poor house the punishment scenes are copycats of Jane Eyre. The standing Anne on the stool and forbidding others to have any contact with her, the cutting of her hair claiming that her hair is the root of the rebellion in her, even the death of a friend in the asylum.This movie is not even worth watching. Watch the movies that they stole from instead.",0

4721,"A tough read: This book is as much about Dr. Drew as it is about his patients, which is fine with me. I'm a big fan of the man and his work. And it is tough work, hard to read about, even harder if you come from a family with a history of addiction and abuse and have someone important in your life dealing with similar problems. It's also tough reading about a professional having trouble fostering trust and waiting for someone to ""get it"" and stick with treatment when they have only the slimmest chance of survival without it. Luckily, it's well-written, breezy, and will only take a couple evenings to finish. It's well worth the time and it's an enlightening look at addiction, why it exists, and what can be done to fix it.",1

UIt talks about her struggles as a college student and a stripper, but unfortunately too many questions are still left unanswered. The author does nothing to portray the stripping scene, the competition between strippers, the customers. In my opinion, the book lacks any sense of reality. It basically only covers a girls sob story as to why she was forced to strip for a living, nothing else.",0
4726,"Wonderful art: I remember reading this book many years ago as a child, and only recently read it again. The thing that stands out most about this book are the bright illustrations.

To tell you the truth he didn't give it his all. Meth is a really creative person, but he was creative enough for this album. The beats are boring and the lyrics are just alright. Honestly the only song i liked are ""The Turn"" this song is def. 5 stars. Some alright songs that might catch peoples attention are ... ""The Show"" ""Who Ya'll Rollin Wit"" ""Crooked Letter I"" ""Baby Come on"" ""Say What"" and ""Whats Happenin"". Those songs are somewhat stand out tracks for the commercial fans, but personally those songs aren't my flavor. The other ok song in my eye is ""Afterparty"".

I think there are many others out there from the '70's who were in the same boat and did not have anyone to talk to about the abuse they were suffering at home. Like the author, we went to school to escape home life. I think it is a great book and that everyone should read this true to life story of survival.

They are more than happy to assist anyone in proper installiation. Now it dosen't budge an inch. I really like the fact that it is rear facing as well as the adjustable and memory straps. It is wonderful for my newborn. I also purchased the Night Seeker with it so I can check on my son in the rearview mirror. It dimly lights up the area so I can check on him when we are traveling in the evening. A must have now that daylight savings time is over.

The writing style of this book is not the same as other Agatha books. This one reads like a travelogue. It also is from a male point of view. The plot is boring,the characters are shallow to the point of stupidity and even the reasoning doesn't fit our Agatha. I've done some research on this author and still feel that the Agatha novels are written either by several contributors or ""the author"" has a split personality! This novel is not even related to the good Agatha stories. If any of you fans out there can clear this up for me, please do.",0

4748,"Surprisingly useful: I've been playing guitar for roughly 12 years now, and I had stagnated. While I could play just about anything I wanted to (except a little Django) I had some weaknesses. I had learned theory in school, but it was strictly on paper - I had only applied the knowledge to guitar in the most obvious ways.With increased practice time, I've been looking for more material to learn. I wanted a book that would provide all of the scale exercises I'd need to become a little more fluent in my ability to construct interesting ideas.And this book helps quite a bit!It is a dense book, since it boils theory down to very concise entries. It isn't a book you can fly through, especially if you haven't already known what you were doing.So far, my speed has increased, and my scale knowledge has blossomed.",1

4753,"would recommend: Bought this stroller a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it. It maneuvers very easily and has a lot of space for daiper bag, etc. underneath. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of five is because it's kind of a pain to fold, you have to push the front canopy all the way down first before it will fold properly. Once it does fold, it folds up pretty nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space considering it is a double stroller. It would also be nice if the front tray folded up to make it easier for the child to get in. Overall though this stroller is definately worth the money and the two complaints really aren't that bad, I really just put them in there for people like myself who are buying this online and can't take an in person look at the item before buying it.",1

4758,"Great Anthology: The Four Tops are legends and listening to this clearly shows it. The songs drive hard: pleading, begging, concession--all done well. Even songs that were covers (Walk Away Renee) sound very good. ""Walk Away Renee"" in particular makes the Left Banke version sound like a weak whine. ""Bernadette"" epitomizes the passionate and emotionally exhausting narrative Levi Stubbs presents. Songs like ""I'm in a Different World"" while not major hits still sound pretty good!",1

4760,"Beautiful: I don't normally buy graphic novels. Nothing at all against them, I'm just not into that medium. However, I am pleased to add MASQUES book 2 to my collection. This slim volume contains 3 short stories, each presented in wonderfully illustrated styles by different artists. The first story is ""Better Than One"" by Paul Dale Anderson. It's a taut little tale with only one character....well, only one body, that is. ""If You Take My Hand, Son"" by Mort Castle is a disturbing little story following Johnny's thoughts as he withers in a coma; it'll make you think about ""going into the light"" a bit differently. And finally ""Popsy"" by Stephen King has that Tales From the Crypt feel to it as well as a nice moral tale to teach us to be nicer to kids. I truly wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, but it really brought home my childhood days when I used to curl up with a good comic book. The art is beautiful, the stories are chilling, and the writing is superb. I'm glad I ordered this!",1

4762,"Abysmal: Lewis is supposed to be a major scholar of Islam but this book would probably fail a high school assignment. He may be an expert on the Ottoman Empire but he hasn't set foot in the Middle East for 40 years - and his lack of exposure shows in this book. When you take into account Lewis' neo-Conservative propensities, it becomes easier to understand the context, and more importantly the motivations, behind his work. Deeply disappointing.",0

So far they have put out about 70MB of patches to version ACT 2005 and its still has extreme problems. I shipped it back.I had use Goldmine intermittently for other businesses but never used it that deeply. I went ahead and got the most recent release of Goldmine. What a powerful program and sooooo much faster than ACT 2005. It has its own idiosyncrasies also, but they are minor. I'm just sorry that I didn't make the switch to Goldmine sooner. My only fear is that they are working on a new release, v7.0 as a matter fact, and I hope their v7.0 does not destroy a great program as Best Software has done to ACT!",0
4766,"Unreliable for certain key combinations: I ran into trouble when using the left shift and left windows keys simultaneously. For example, I remapped the keys for use on my Mac and then used shift-windows-arrowkey during text editing. Those two modifiers, when used in concert, register only about half the time; the rest of the time, only the arrow key is sent. I'm sure it's the adapter, since it happens on my Dell AT101W and the keyboard from an old HP Pavilion. The latter keyboard doesn't have this problem when using a simpler passthrough USB/PS2 adapter.

It was the second anime I ever watched and I was in love with it from the beginning theme. You can imagine my delight when I found out that they were going to translate and release the manga here in the States'. Not to mention that I love Tokyopop. Anyways, the manga is wonderful and I love the read. The characters are great. I only have one little complaint. First of all, the anime really doesn't stay true to the manga. I had no idea that Shuichi has a sister. This goes along with the fact that the drawings aren't as great as the anime ones. Though still wonderfully drawn I think Murakami-san should have drawn them more closely together. Other then that I suggest this to any shounen-ai lover.",1

I chose the book to read because I like to read and pretty much lived my younger life lost in books.

4775,"One Victorian woman's adventures exploring West Africa: Travels in West Africa is a witty, quirky, fascinating work. Mary Kingsley's wry sense of humor had me laughing out loud. A self-educated Victorian woman, she traveled alone to West Africa in 1893 to study the natives' religions and customs and collect fish for the British Museum. Unlike most European explorers, she lived with the people, ate their foods, learned their languages. She continued to dress in proper Victorian clothes despite the heat and inconvenience of hiking in long skirts. She was the first white woman most natives had ever seen. MK was one of the first who felt the white man was ruining the balance in Africa and should stop meddling in the natives' lives and customs. It's not surprising the book is still in print 101 years after first being published. This particular edition is very good.",1

4777,"I wasn't charmed...: I wasn't charmed by ""the Cry of the Crow"" like many other have. Although the book finds a smart way to teach us a lesson about the hidden effects of what we do in life, the story lacks fantasy, action, and adventure. Only Mandy and her crow are described in detail and the story would have been about the same without the other characters. Even Mandy and her crow's love for one another didn't jump out from the pages. I found it difficult to care for them in the end.",0

Heater is designed to sit on the floor. All the controls are mounted on the vertical flat surface on the front face, near the top of the heater. That means you have to really squat down and place your head around your knees to set the temperature. You cant tilt the heater back or the tip over switch kicks in and shuts it down. Other than this design flaw on accessing the controls, its a very good value. I noticed very little smell on initial start up.",1

It's also written with an extreme anti-semitic leaning.According to this book every person of note that has ever exchanged a handshake with another is a member of the terrifying ILLUMINATI! Every person that has ever crossed their arms or legs...ILLUMINATI! Every Jewish person or Qabalist...? You guessed it.Pictures of the Bush family doing the Texas A&M; ""hook 'em horns"" AT the Texas A&M; marching band is evidence of their Satan worship.

Green's Nightside books, (say, ""Something From the Nightside"").That way you can have a lot of fun with how cleverly Mieville lays his alternate London right over the top of ""real"" London. Enjoy the zest and unruly imagination of a deeply original writer.Then compare with the almost stately, restrained elegance of Gaiman's approach to alternate-London. Gaiman's imagination is just boundless, and every page is infused with his great sense of place, and his deft touch. Sure the book is ""dark"", but only in a thrilling sense, not the world weary, or ironic, or hopeless style of many current writers.For a change-up go to the Nightside of London, with the noirish, tongue-in-cheek, and much more fantastical Green.Really, what a trifecta.",1

Credits goes to the DJ's who have done a good job. Caution if you want mixes like Trevor Horn did in the 80's this is not for you. If you are open minded towards EuroHouse than this double cd is the thing to get. Conclusion: A nice blend between Frankie and EuroHouse",1

The price on this lamp has come way down over the last couple of years, the first one we bought was almost one hundred dollars, now you can get them for 35-40, which makes it worth buying the lamps every year or so rather than replacing the TV.

I'm all for humorous stories of sexual encounters, but that is not what this is. I was bored through most of it and cringing through the rest.

There is a chapter on party recipes, a chapter on holiday recipes (with the kids back at home) a chapter on passing down those family favorites, and even one for dinners on nights the kids visit.The chapter on skillet dinners for two contains as many recipes for 4 as it does 2. I also question the authors idea of a portion size. While she mentions 4 oz of protein, her recipes are much larger: Peppered Jack Daniel's Steak which claims to serve two calls for 4 rib eye steaks.

4824,"Attention Sega: Learn to use the Wii Remote!: This game had a lot of potential, but didn't live up to it. The one player game is like other Super Monkey Ball games and uses the Wii remote fairly well to control it. Nothing special, but not bad.The multi-player games all look fun, but the controls are AWFUL! Completely awful! After playing Wii Sports we all know the Wii can do so much better (for example, a better multiplayer party game, Raving Rayman Rabbids, has absolutely no control problems). Just as bad, the pre-game explanation of how to use the Wii controls are unclear at best.This game is best avoided. Maybe rent it sometime, but save your $50 for a good game (RRR, Zelda, Trauma Center, etc.).",0

4834,Not much for $50: I looked around at what was on the market. This unit looked good. I went with it over the Oregon Scientific products because I wanted to have a regular radio as well. First the unit is much poorer quality they you would expect by the brand name and pictures. It works OK but the design of the front panel controls is poor. I am always bumping on the light or some other function or bumping off some function. The front selection knobs stick out and move easily. I can not recommend another unit that has both weather and regular so I bought this one. Think carefully before you buy this unit.,0

Corporal punishment, threats to safety, and parental disapproval are all too common and real themes in the lives of some children. Dressing it up with beautiful illustrations and artful storytelling doesn't take the sting and concern about of the stories themselves. I find the stories disturbing, and so did my child at age three. I have put these stories away -- there are so many better books that give children positive messages, not fearful ones.",0

This author is only one of the sorry crowd who destroy interest in even the most eager seeker. Our schools are full of them.

The information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable.The pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries. The bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit, so the pieces don't lie flat as you make the puzzle. This is frustrating, and you don't get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in, as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesn't quite flatten down. I'm trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books, but I suspect it's just a problem of cheap glue.Still, I give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find, and the content is good.",1

I mean really, the actors can't even control their rage while shooting a movie? Thats the kind of stuff you see happening on a high school campus, not on a movie set.Amazon asked me ""Under 13?"", and for a reason.

Not only is it reputed as having very accurate historical content, but the ficitonal stories running through it were very interesting as well. It is still hard to believe this was Roberts first writing foray. It is very easy to feel for the characters and want to know how everything turns out. I have to say that their plight was often very difficult - to the point where I was feeling quite cold and hungry myself. I live in Vermont and felt quite badly for them travelling during winter under very harsh conditions without polypropelyne, fleece, or wind-blocking layers. Plus a bunch of power bars for emergencies. I will be getting Roberts other books in this series. I'm sure I will enjoy them as much as Arundel. It is easy to tell Roberts has true writing talent.",1

Boy was I wrong!!Page after page after page I found myself feeling frustrated by the dialogue between characters, as well as wanting to edit out words entirely from each sentence. Although the topic of cloning is in itself an interesting idea for a book, this author tap danced around the issue with such a watery thin plot and characters that I felt like I had wasted my time by the end of the book. We get to the end of the story where Kathy and Tommy meet face to face with the women to ran Hailsham....and their conversation was so ridiculously wordy and stupid that I seriously chucked this book across my car.

We, as parents, should find the balance which is right for our child. As with any parenting book I have read, I extrapolate what is helpful for both my child and I.Mr Ezzo does state strong ideas about the family bed and on-demand feeding which obviously offends some people, but if one is open to seeing beyond that one is likely to find helpful tools to add to their parenting tool bag.

I used it this afternoon while building a chicken coop. I'd buy it for the cams alone and am thinking it might be worth drilling holes in the base of a better quality wood constructed box to use these useful little chaps.

4900,"Scary and regressive: I may be the only person on the planet with this opinion, but I did not like the message of this movie. The story is paternalistic in the extreme, displaying an overt and highly conservative agenda. I couldn't believe it. The Lions are a dictatorship supported by the animals in the jungle with a Nazi-ish zeal. A male child is born and seen as a savior? Where's the mom in all this? Where are the females at all except to giggle and bat their eyes, and to create male heirs?",0
4901,"a large cloud of smug: I've been through this book a few times now. I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right. I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time. Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion. It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone.",0
4902,"An eye-opening, reassuring and motivating book - for Britain: After I read the first three chapters of this incredible book, I rang the Christian book store where I bought it here in England, and told them I would buy the other six copies they had in stock! I gave these to my wife, to a couple church leaders, and a couple of the ""less motivated"" church members. They also captured the easily picked up insights about relationship building as a worthy way to assist the Holy Spirit in opening hearts, ears and minds to the saving love of Jesus Christ. The methods are not difficult to understand or to apply. The principles in this book are what the churches in England, Wales, Scotland, and all of Ireland need to put into practice. Your life, whether you are a Christian (yet) or not, will be positively affected by this book. I cannot praise it highly enough!",1
4903,"Great Concert !!!!!: P-Funk fans, this is pure unadultered Funk. This concert is the epitome of what Funk is all about. The Mothership Connection Tour is something to behold.

4905,"Very good textbook: No textbook is really worth 5 stars, in my estimation, because that is reserved for books that actually entertain me! Textbooks seldom do that. However, this auditing text is pretty darn good.Each chapter is packed with true case studies, which are all interesting. The actual text material is easy to understand and read. There are HOARDS of questions, simulations, etc. in the back of each chapter. And the online materials the come with it are good as well, including some basic videos.I came into my auditing class with little knowledge of that specific subject. I felt I left it some weeks later with a good understanding (good enough to pass the Auditing portion of my CPA exam on the first go around). So if you're assigned this text for YOUR auditing class, be happy. It's pretty good, and won't put you instantly to sleep...not many texts can say that!!",1

4907,"informative, a neccessary book: Being a Hare Krishna, I found the book revealed the frailties of the human mind without the direct touteledge of their guru. The book is well written, from a Karmi point of view, however unless people are informed about the true nature of the ISKCON movement, it can be misleading. It tells of some of the horrible events that took place on the land of a community, however, this leader, Kirtanananda, was very delusional, not a true bona fide guru. Read this book, by all means, but keep in perspective that any one side of the story isn't the whole side, and if Prabhupada had been alive at the time of those events, they would never have taken place. Read and appreciate the love for Krishna that the true devotees have in this book. Those who are not true devotees, as any religious community has, are just hypocrites.",1

4910,I miss the DVD: I loved Jim Heid's iLife '05 book because of the integration with the included DVD. You could easily follow along in the book while Jim demonstrated each feature in the DVD and there were good cross-references. The '05 book was the best money I have EVER spent on a computer book. But iLife '06 doesn't include the DVD..... still a very good book but no longer so outstanding. I guess it just got to be too hard to produce a timely DVD with features being added to iLife and new versions coming out so fast. Too bad.,1

They were scratched or had major flaws in them that affected play. Fox should be ashamed of double sided disks for such a great show. Called them twice and found that they don't care. In fact, the first time, they hung up on me. Said that we must have gotten disconnected. Tried e-mailing them and because I didn't buy them from Fox's website, I couldn't e-mail them. Please Fox. Get rid of double sided disks. Or at least get somebody who knows how to burn them correctly.",1

(im not kidding there were actually dinosaurs......dont ask me how) if ou really want a good action anime that has at least some semblance of a story line get akira or outlaw star. if youre new to anime steer clear of this one lest it tarnish your opinion of the genra forever..........but seriously get akira.......it rox!,0
4915,"Led Zeppelin?: Over the past two years, this band has received the most hype I can remember since Pavement or (yecch) Hole almost 10 years ago. Do they deserve it? Well, they are pretty good--I can't believe nobody has mentioned Royal Trux, since they sound alot like a de-toxed version of them. Led Zeppelin? They don't sound even remotely like Led Zeppelin. This is slightly better than their first album and about as good as their second, and about as good as Cats and Dogs. Don't expect Physical Graffiti though.",1
4916,"Great, love it.: I love these. I used to get a lot of rings of condensation on my desk from my liquor on the rocks, but now I don't and it's a nice enhancement. I haven't used these with hot liquids, but I'm assuming they will shine as well. The reviews made me really cautious with these and I set them aside whenever I wash them because I don't want to accidentally drop something on them and break them. I think if you treat them like normal glassware, you'll be disappointed. Take care of them and they should last a while.",1
4917,"CRYPTOPSY - Wanna-be DM!: I totally agree with the reviewer before me! Cryptopsy have definitely gone mainstream! Hell, people that like Cryptopsy listen to Nile, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, ect. ect... Cryptopsy are highly overRated like Nile! The vocals aren't very br-oooo-tal! The songs all sound identical, the drumming & vocals practically drown out the guitars. I like their old vocalist (Lord Worm). Well, if ur skeptical about picking up this CD, I think it would be better to go for their previous opus 'None SO Vile' much much better, filled with violent-well played riffs, killer drumming & vokills! I give None SO Vile 5 STARS! Killer CD! Whisper Supremacy belongs in A Microwave! Go & listen to some Centurian or Disciples of Mockery!",0

4922,"Unique, Harmonious, Uplifting: Sawyer's view of the world may be a little starry- eyed, but his implementation is flawless. This album should be in everyone's collection. I never leave on a long trip without a copy on tape. The world influence is evident. The pure skill at arrangement in ""I Know"" and ""Spoken Word"" is impressive. The voices virtually double as instruments.",1
4923,"This is not a cd that I could get excited over: As you might know Michael worked for Ira Gershwin for several years. He really became biased toward both brothers music, which is fine, I like their music, too.What makes this cd so uneventful, is the fact Michael tried to introduce a lot of Gershwin songs that had never been published and released before. I think Michael should try to stick with the songs that made the brothers popular.I really like Michaels' voice and feel like he is a one of a kind crooner. He really has a bright future ahead. He is for real.I have many more wonderful cds by Michael than this one.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.",0
4924,"truth in a bottle: Reading this book was like opening a capped bottle. A fresh wind took over my life when I opened the book and started to read. At 20, I was becoming disillusioned with religion, it seemed dominating and fake. Conversations with God gave a realistic explanation of God and religion. Walsh asked questions that any human person would ask God if they were truthful to themself. The Book was not heretic, but rather inspirational. It provides hope for persons who fear God; it gives faith to unbelievers that God is not a distant feature of brimstone and fire. I would like to say thank you to the author. He may have never guessed that his work could be so inspirational or historical. But I believe this is a book that everyone should read...with an open mind.",1

There were details in Star Wars III that had escaped my attention before; the picture was so sharp!Just some additional notes:- HDMI conversion upscalable to 1080i...a definite plus.- 2 MB buffer memory makes layer transitions hardly noticeable.- Rating control allows parents to select whether certain movies will play for children or not.All in all, an exceptional professional product for a mainstream user - a definite must for an HD user.",1

Yes, there are some wines that do not get stellar reviews, but the majority of them seem to be copied straight from a winery's marketing mailer. Is she really objective? Word has it that many of the wines she writes about are owned by companies that have paid her to speak.

4943,"Waste of money!: In reading any fictional murder mystery, I like to come across the dead body by the end of the third chapter. This allows the author to introduce the characters and tell the beginning of the plot with lots of time left to investigate everyone involved and reveal the murderous culprit. If you like your novels like I do, avoid this Nancy Fairbanks book!! I most certainly didn't like reading more than 95% of this book to find out who got killed! And there is no investigation or mystery at all; the murderer is standing among several people, holding the pistol she just fired. If you want to read a mystery in which the dead body appears in the very first sentence, read ""Dark Tort"" by Diana Mott Davidson.",0

Compared with those two writers Ms. Presberg comes across as an amateur. Her publisher compares her book with Richard Powell's Tickets to the Devil. I read that book many years ago, and in my opinion Ms. Presberg's book does not come close. As a bridge player I found her bridge examples particularly dull. I am certainly not an expert on police procedures, but I doubt if any professional police officer would have acted as she portrayed the police in her novel. As a mystery fan, I found a total lack of any suspense. Ms. Presberg did do a good job of hiding the identity of the perpetrator until the end.",0

I usually don't notice things like lighting, but the excessive shadows everywhere sort of made me take notice. The sets are virtually non-existent. All the walls are bare - they didn't even have the decency to hang up some tapestries. I only made it through Catherine and Anne but the actresses were WAY too old for their parts. Catherine looks at least 30 at the beginning when she is supposed to be 16. And the worst part was that this series was downright boring. I can live with all of the above so long as they tell a good story. The producers didn't even need to come up with a good story - they had one, right in front of them, and this is what they did with it.",0

At first I didn't think that I would like such a wacky mushy love story, since I'm really into adventure, but this book turned out to be the book that has changed my whole opinion on life. It's inspirational, witty, and extremely hilarious, like when Gertrudis sets the bathroom on fire and runs away naked with a revolutionary soldier. There are parts where you can laugh out loud and parts that will make your eyes water. It's also fun because there a specific recipes that you yourself can experiment with.

But to focus on this album, one cannot help but notice how damn talented the boys of Blink 182 really are. As a lifelong fan of even the poorly recorded albums Chesire Cat and the Buddah record, I can attest that on this album, Blink has taken the time to write a ridiculously good album. Fans of the c!@k in cheek humor of take off... and enema..., should take note that Travis IS the best drummer along with Chad from 311, and that the songwriting/singing duo of Tom and Mark is much more smart and cynical than most would've thought. With songs like asthenia, stockholm syndrome, and down, we see where their heads really are, and if you listen to the bridge between violence and stockholm, you'll get the picture.

I added water and soap for the initial cleaning, and hit pulse and sure enough water spewed out the top. Then I noticed the lid was just sort of sitting on the top of the jar. If you put the lid on tight, it does not spew or leak. The edges of the lid should fit tightly over the brim of the jar. Even though I've only used my Blendtec for smoothies two times so far, it did a remarkable job. The first time I used blackberries and had to run the smoothie setting twice to make the seeds less noticeable. I could still feel them a little after the second run, but they didn't stick in my teeth so they didn't bother me.

If you do want this CD ROM for your collection, I recommend also getting a text so that questions which you may have will get answered. The CD does not address probe angle for any view, nor does it address technique as far as removing artifact.

4968,"Wonderful Book about a little known woman!: I've been doing a lot of reading lately about the time just before and after of the Great War, the War to End All Wars: World War 1.In doing so, I read a lot about Louise Bryant, who is usually a footnote in the life of John Reid. This was a well-written and interesting book that allows for understanding the real Louise Bryant and what made her tick. She was a woman ahead of her time and unfortunately, the injustice she receives because of that, creates many demons that she tried to overcome by alcohol and affairs.",1
4969,"Great product, for exactly one year.: The FPE-3205 has an inverter problem that will kill your picture in about a year.I bought it at BJs too. Now I have a 40# paperweight.The part is not readily available, and Audiovox will not stand behind this product.",0
4970,"Claudius - a good seed in a bad garden.: Being a fan of historical fiction, I eagerly devoured this book. It did not disappoint! Although it falls short of classics like Aztec (which kept a healthy balance between political machinations and good old-fashioned adventure), I Claudius is truly riveting. The best thing about the book is that it saves the best for last -- Claudius' dealings with Caligula towards the end of the novel are both horrifying and hilarious.",1
4971,"too many mistakes: I wouldn't re-make 90% of the meals I've made from these recipes, and I've tried a bunch of them. My family isn't picky, so they eat it, but none of us love the food. It is convenient to be able to make two extra meals to freeze when making dinner, but it isn't worth it when we aren't looking forward to pulling them out of the freezer. Also, I was surprised to see just how many mistakes there were in the recipes. It's a nice idea, but it's just not worth the money. I'll be trying another freezer cookbook.",0
4972,"Great Cover: Bought it for my Macbook Pro 15"" and it fits perfectly. It is a must have. If you want to protect your machine, I would recommend having this. It is easy to put on and it comes right off if you need it to. Doesn't slide off and it has opening for the CD drive and all ports. I love it.",1
4973,"Item works with original PIS: EDITED REVIEW: This tubing actually works with the original PIS (as well as the new PISA manufactured post 07/2006). Set 4 Baby's packaging and customer service reps rudely insisted that the item I was sent will not work with the original PIS and that I had made a mistake in ordering. Set 4 Baby also attempted to charge $6.56 in shipping, even though the product pages state ""free shipping."" Set 4 Baby was extremely difficult to deal with and would not accept any responsibility for the problem. I would not recommend doing business with Set 4 Baby under any circumstances.When editing this review, I could not change the star rating. Just to be clear, I now know that the tubing is fine, but still am not pleased with the third party seller.",0
4974,okay: I was hoping this would have a little more to it. It has gorgeous pictures but it would have made a better calendar than a book. If you are looking just for pictures then this will be great.,0
4975,"Not the UK version.: The only thing I needed to know was whether or not this bluray was the UK (original) version or the chopped up US version. I ordered it, watched it, it is the chopped up (US) version. Hopefully further reviews of other Revolver dvd/bluray releases will contain that kind of information. :/ I can't seem to find the UK version anywhere.",0
4976,"ILoverandCompany: This was part of a last minute Christmas gift along with other DVDs I purchased and it came in great time before Christmas. The packaging was great, and the DVD was in perfect condition. Great movie, great timing and great packaging! No Complaints here :)",1
4977,"I cried buckets over this AMAZING book!: Nicholas Sparks has such a wonderful gift for making a reader feel every emotion possible. I laughed, and mostly cried through this whole book. But don't misunderstand, it was the kind of cry that makes you feel so good afterwards. The spiritual emphasis in this book was something I enjoyed very much. It is going to make a great Christmas gift for all of my friends!",1
4978,"Loved it as a kid: This is a fun book that I came across at a book fair and recognized as an old childhood favorite. The basic theme is that Grover keeps saying not to turn the page, and then humorously berates you when you do turn the page. So now my niece is getting a copy! If your kid likes Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus by Mo Willems, he or she will like this book too.",1
4979,"illogical: The premise for this book is totally stupid. I finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't.SPOILERAn example of how dumb: Two high level secret service agents find a weapon put it in the glove compartment of their car. Do not lock the glove box, don't lock the car. It gets stolen while their in the house. Is this dumb or what?",0
4980,"Waste of MONEY and TIME!: I bought this expensive toy for my son's birthday and it NEVER worked. The controller does not get a signal and there is nothing in the manual about how to solve this issue. We discovered a tiny ""sync"" button on the controller and on the car itself, but still doesn't work. I called Wild Planet and have left SEVERAL messages during business hours and no one has returned my call. I finally got a person on live chat who suggested I repress the sync buttons, did that AGAIN... the car still doesn't work. Then they asked me to ship the car to them to have it refurbished!!! ugh! I'm returning this one. Now that I have read other reviews online, I wish I had bought something else for my son so he wouldn't have suffered such a huge disappointment on his 6th birthday.",0
4981,Disappointed: We purchased this for when we had unexpected guests. This bed only lasted one use. We woke up to find our guests on the couch because the air bed deflated halfway through the night. We checked for holes but couldn't find one. We ended up just throwing it away.,0
4982,Road to Independence: Great Educational Experience: Animated history lesson. Enjoyed watching it and got an education to boot. This is great for the family and for sharing with friends. Find out just exactly what in to the founding of our country; it wasn't as easy as it was portrayed in junior high. Get a copy and watch it; you won't be disappointed.,1
4983,"A challenging social commentary for modern times: Crowded Land Of Liberty: Solving America's Immigration Crisis by former Reagan campaign official, banker, entrepreneur, and public policy issues expert Dirk Chase Eldredge is a challenging social commentary for modern times. Eldredge examines America's population boom and how work can be done to improve quality of life for born citizens and naturalized citizens alike. Individual chapters address the pitfalls of assimilation, the essence of asylum and amnesty, and the very real need to balance an influx of people with a broader social service and school base. Crowded Land Of Liberty is highly recommended as a sincere, timely, and thought-provoking treatise on a critically important social issue, especially in a time of increased concerns for public safety, national security, and immigration policies.",1
4984,"Superb scholarly text: This was my 2nd purchase from Amazon back in 1999. You couldn't find this book anywhere else at the time. I'm glad it's been reprinted.This is a wonderful book, describing in great detail the spread of the cult of Isis throughout the ancient world, and the contributions to our modern society. It's a little dry, but there really is nothing else out there like this book. I have a vast library of books on Ancient Egypt and this is the one I value the most.",1
4985,"socks: Merino Wool/Silk socks are easily the best socks I have ever had,also the most expensive, but worth it",1
4986,"Excellent product for the price: I love this heart rate monitor. The band is rubbery so it is comfortable. As far as I can tell the monitor is accurate. I am very pleased with this product. I do wish it were a little simpler to set and that the chest band were easier to attach, but other than that, this personal heart rate monitor is great!",1
4987,Cutthroat Island: Geena Davis did an outstanding job of acting. It's a very dynamic and exciting movie. Keeps you interested throughout. Enjoyed the movie and it's a keeper!,1
4988,"Excellent: This by far is my favorite Stephen King read to date. I've only read a few of his books, but this one kept me glued to the pages, wondering what would happen next. Probably helped that I'd seen the movie before reading this, but I absolutely enjoyed every page.",1
4989,"Mole Chaser - doesn't work: I bought 2 of these for a fairly small front yard, about 50ft by 50ft. Installed the first one 2 weeks ago. The moles built a new outlet about 12 ft from the mole chaser. I then installed the second one about 25 ft from the first one last weekend. The moles built another outlet about 2ft from their other hole and about half way between the 2 mole chasers. I am going to leave them in operation to see if they will drive the moles off. Right now, I am skeptical that the mole chasers will do any better than they have done so far.",0
4990,LOVED IT!: I absolutely loved this book. I don't usually read a book in a matter of a few weeks but this one I flew through. I could not put it down. I was very surprised. I had owned it for years but never read it and I am so glad I did. I highly recommend this book for a beginner or for a seasoned witch like myself. Great read!,1
4991,"Worth Watching To See Gort Get What He Deserves: This is a somewhat different presentation of a bank-robbery story involving an alcoholic computer expert blackmailed into service by some really sickening dudes who have kidnapped his son. The head robber, code name Bellman, is a ghastly individual, as is his particularly unpleasant henchman, Gort.Gort gets killed during the robbery in a horrific accident, an extremely disturbing scene that merely underscores the Bellman's coldness. The accident portrayed is so unexpected, so heretofore out-of-place in this film, that its impact upon the viewer is stunning. And at the same time, it could not have happened to a nicer guy.This is a good movie to see once. It's probably not one you'll want to view again, but you will want to lend it to friends.",1
4992,"Shows the convictions of the former pope during his life time: Many people believe that the former pope stood for the Word of God. If you read the book and honestly compare it's content with what the Bible says, you will find, that this was not true. Otherwise the book is a waist of time and it will be better spend if you read the Bible itself.",0
4993,"A dark and powerfully written novel: Set in the Appalachian South, One Foot in Eden by Ron Rash is a dark and powerfully written novel of love, secrets, and murder. An unsolved killing remains covered up for years until one day the power company forces people off their land and floods their farms. Terrible hidden motives beneath a closely bound rural community pervade this fascinating and engaging literary study showcasing the turns and twists of human nature.",1
4994,"Must have kitchen gadget.: Being these types of thermometers are so much better and easier to use Vs the traditional tube type it뗩 tuff to say anything negative. Except for the ease of setting the temperature and/or timer each time it뗩 used. This particular model has been a breeze; being my wife threw out the packaging & instructions, when I went to use it all I had to do was just set the temperature and hit start. It was that easy. Do note there is an on/off switch on the back that I뗛 recommend one use it when it뗩 not in use to conserve the battery. I뗛 recommend it to anyone. Also, the cable is very flexible; more so than the steel braided one this one replaced, and so far is as durable.",1
4995,"Circular Saw Usage: If you can pay a little attention, the way it works is it spins with the blade... pretty straight forward and most of you get that. For those of you complaining about why they don't make it fit a circular saw... Think about it... The laser wouldn't hit the line on the board... The lasers on circular saws are outside of the blade compartment, and towards the front pointing down towards the line. If you were to put this on a circular saw... it is most likely, that you would not see any laser on the line at all... just a laser where it is just about to cut.",1
4996,"7th grade writing coupled with 5th grade philosophy: This is the only book I have ever returned to get my money back! This book was only designed (poorly) to extract money from lost-soul new-agers with no taste for literature and no knowledge of philosophy. One painfully wades ones way through all of the instances of the word ""suddenly"" (suddenly this happened, suddenly that...) and all of the nine ""insights"" only to find that one must purchase yet another book to learn the tenth ""insight"". The end papers of the book even contain an advertisement and order form for the Philistine Prophecy Newsletter! It is blatent commercialism and exploitation badly executed. The only reason I read this book past the first chapter was to be able to fully critique it at my book group. Here's an ""insight"": Don't Waste Your Money! and: If you did - Take the Book Back and Demand a Refund!",0
4997,"Doesn't work!: This Electronic Racket doesn't work, even when trying it in a swarm of mosquitos. Not one zapped! I did get a lot of arm exercise trying to get it to work. This is a waste of your money. I recommend don't buy this. Sending it back costs too much. Another worthless piece of junk to toss.",0
4998,"Office Depot cartridge is no good: The Office Depot Model 56 Black Ink Cartridge is supposed to be a replacement for the HP 56 cartridge. It's not good. It worked for a very short time and then all of the sudden it couldn't be recognized by the printer anymore. I took it back to Office Depot and they refunded my money and let me upgrade to the HP 56 cartridge for the difference of the cost between the two, which was $3.25. Save yourself the trip and buy the HP 56 from the start.",0
4999,"SWAT SEASON 2: Great series that sadly didn't last long due to outcry of violence on tv at that time (but very tamed by today's measures)glad the second and sadly the last season was finally release after a 6 year gap between this and the first season release, the quality is quite good along with the sound, it even included the episode ""dangerous memories"" which was a unaired episode. I wish this set would have included the pilot episode which actually is a two part The Rookies episode, hopefully that series will come complete soon. This series brings back alot of memories of my childhood TV was so great back in the 70's and this series proves it again this is a must get along with the first season of this great short-lived but beloved series!!!!",1
