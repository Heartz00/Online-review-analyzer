0,Very good: These shifters are very nice to hold and use and seem very strong. However i did have a little problem where i couldn't get the mouth to open up fully as some of the shifter where the moving head was had been rounded and wouldn't allow the head to move past that point. however a little grind and they are working pefectly.,1
1,"1982 nearly 30 years out of date!: Macquarie dictionary is an excellent dictionary, but the edition offered for sale here is nearly 30 years out of date having been published in 1982. The better 5th edition was published in 2005.",0
2,"This is the complete book: This book should be called the complete exercise book. This book touches on everything. There are sections for the abs, upper body, thighs, hips & butt individually and a complete total-body program as well. They provide ways to do various exercises at home and in the gym. There are even recipes for delicious low-fat meals. The color pictures looked great too. This a well put together book.",1
3,More fuel for hate: More fuel for hate...that's what Yakos' book's all about: hate and ignorance. Little wonder then that because of this blind Jeudo-christian hate for Islam and Muslims radicals such as Bin Laden are born.Paul,0
4,"A let down after the first two volumes: The prose is remarkably bad -- remarkably because the first two volumes in this series, while not likely to win an award for style, were written in a solid, brisk and workmanlike way.This installment, produced about five years after the first two, reads like a first-draft. It is bloated with personal histories of even the most minor characters, pages of repetitious arguments and endless measurements of each and every object (come on, do we need to know that a fictious mountain is 9,144ft or simply that it's higher than our characters can climb?).Overall, Riverworld would have made a great trilogy. But one has the impression that the publisher, knowing that the first two books had developed such a following, decided not to whittle down Farmer's original 400,000-word manuscript for this book. That's a shame for readers, even if it meant that the publisher could sell more books.",0
5,"Carl Craig always shoots twice: Every week,you read/heard/see about a band/artist which just have done an album which is supposed to be a re-interpretation or mix of the different black style of music (jazz, funk, etc...) I am no authority for those genres but there is only one disc on which i agree with the official reviewer: innerzone ""programmed"" Altough it is a concept album (explore every music style from Black culture through techno) you never feel like listening to a ""Barnum disc"" or some kind of compilation.It is in fact a very coherent album filled with excellent titles. A very good CD, however it is not a match for Carl Craig precedent masterpiece (more songs about...)",1
6,"This is a one of classics of world poeme: Nazm Hikmet is my first poet.I am a poet also and he's my master.I loved him all books certainly,but Rubaiyat,to me,is him best.",1
7,Excellent: Super fast shipment and twin boys are enjoying and having fun working on books over the summer. Will purchase again next year. Thanks.,1
8,"5 Stars For This Powerful Raw Recording of a Great 80's Band - Negative 4 Stars For The Independent Sellers: I have listened to all of these tracks. They are unrefined, gritty, and fantastic. I saw these guys perform live around the time this recording was made. They were great. This recording captures the essence of the band. I recommend buying it.But not for 50 dollars. What a rip off! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy from these independent seller clowns. I just purchased this CD for 18 bucks on an independent seller website. It's easy to find merely by doing a google search.Let the buyer beware!Update: A couple of days ago I talked to the vender who sold me this CD. He said that he's a good friend of one of the band members. He also said that they plan on doing another pressing of this CD. So save some bucks and wait just a little longer.",0
9,"Great side project...: This album does not quite stand up to Wilco and O'Rourke's previous works, nor does it aspire to. This album feels first and foremost like a side project. And that's what's great about it. It sounds as if these lads bunkered up in a studio and just had some good fun. Some say it's a logical progression from YHF, but I think that's too simplistic. It's not an evolution, it's an outlet of where these guys are.",1
10,"Morrissey as Center of the Universe: With the exception of one track I did not like this CD at all. I found it to be too over-the-top-self-indulgent, for my taste, and lyrically rambling. The big controversial ""America Is Not the World"" starts off strong, but ends up in an immature kind of rant, which is unfortunate, because I think the idea behind the song is important. I think Morrissey is a phenomenal talent, but many songs on this CD made me cringe. ""I'm Not Sorry"" , however, is the sole exception. Go to I-Tunes and buy that song & maybe track 1 if you're curious, but I'd pass on the rest.",0
11,"Boring!: This movie was so slow I could not finish it. I can not see what critics see in this film or how it made it to be the fifth best on AFI's list. This film has no women at all. Interesting beginning, though.",0
12,"Three old men, too old to rock and roll....: I cannot believe that people actually listen to the live Cream reunion CD and compare it to ANY of their live stuff from the past! There's NoFire in their instrumentation, and the vocals are weak. N.S.U.? It's a joke! Everything sounds like it's being played at half-speed. It might have been phenomenal to see them live again after 35+ years, but I don'thear it in the music. Compare Live Cream, Volume II to the 2005 versionand you'll hear the difference.",0
13,I've seen the movies already: This book gives a synopsis of all David Lean movies. It is useless unless someone needs to know about movies they have not seen. I wanted to read about behind-the-scenes activities in each of his movies and was chagrined when I looked over this book. I waited too long to return it so all I can do is warn others: buyer beware.,0
14,Excellent: This is a very good quaility and looks very nice in the room where I put it. I would buy other things from this company.,1
15,"Not A Great Racer.: This game is full of bugs and poorly designed animations which get irritating after a few minutes of playing. When you get the hang of it, its not a bad game, but when you wipe-out there are long annoying sequences with the rider hanging inexplicably in mid-air or suddenly becoming transparent (!)The game engine seems very close to the snowboarding game 'SSX Tricky', which I would highly recommend as it is flawless in gameplay and design, plus faster and more satisfying!",0
16,"Pure idiot!: the only reason i gave him a 1 star was because there was no 0 star available. Frankly after watching this, I realised Martin Lawrence is the biggest idiot on television.One example. He talked about how sept. 11 brought united the blacks and whites. In his next sentence he talks about how the blacks and whites united to discriminate those who looked arab decent and according to him ""looked like bin-ladin."" he gives an example by saying how he pulled the turban off an indian man.wow. what a display of how racism suddenly didnt matter anymore... or between the blacks and whites atleast.i could go on, but i dont want to waste my time on it anymore.",0
17,"much needed specialized review: I was the type of person whom the author describes as familiar on a superficial level with oscillators and their use in trading. This book took me to a deeper level. Lots of good stuff and depth. The author is not shy in documenting oscillators weak-points either, so it's not just a market cheerleading book. Kind of overpriced for a pretty thin paperback, but I'm not sorry I bought it.",1
18,"waste: If you are a college professor looking to brush up, then it is fine, otherwise this book is terrible.",0
19,"Traveling the Worlds of the Political Through the Personal: Rich's finely-crafted poems draw on her experiences as a Peace Corps worker in Niger, West Africa, a human rights educator in Gaza, an electoral monitor in Bosnia, a program coordinator for Amnesty International, and a daughter who has lost both parents. Each poem speaks with the credible, particular voice of one who has been there and seen without blinking or romanticizing. The griefs and atrocities are balanced with erotic poems that reveal an unabated appetite for connection and life. The art of cartography forms the image base of the whole book; even the erotic poems employ the vocabulary of map-making and geometry in surprising, evocative ways. Rich's intelligent and perceptive voice make her a compelling guide to the worlds of ""The Cartographer's Tongue.""",1
20,"could be better: I purchased this mixer because of the Kitchenaid name which I equated with quality. From the first use, I was disappointed in the lack of power this mixer has when mixing cookie dough. I have owned much cheaper mixers that did a superior job. After owning this mixer for approximately two years, one of the metal bars on the beaters came unattached, making the mixer useless. I will not be buying another Kitchenaid mixer.",0
21,Italinan Now! A Level One Worktext: Going to a class and it follows the book. Easy to understand - I'm glad I bought it. Might buy Level Two soon.,1
22,"Item received was not what I ordered.: The doll I ordered was not what I received. And, I returned the doll over a month ago, and as of yet have not received a refund. What a disappointment since I usually have good service with Amazon.com.",0
23,Kindle review: This is a great device. It took no time to get started. Takes only a few seconds to from the time you order until the book or magazine is on your device. The text is easy to read and adjustable fonts comes in handy. The only book I had problems with is a cookbook unlike the regular books which has links to the chapters the cookbook did not have links to the recipes. Other than that it is a great device and I would recommend it to everyone. Very easy to use.,1
24,"Nice graphics terrible game play: I rented this game before deciding to buy. The game looks nice however the game play itself is horrible. I found the planes not very controllable. There is so much a game writer could do to make a game like this great, graphics are just eye candy. Dont waste your money on this one.",0
25,"Boooorrrrrrrinnnng: Jeez, what is this? The tenth, twelth book on Hanssen? Wise only tells us things that we (1) have already heard or (2) don't care about. This story is so old there have already been""Made for TV"" movies about it. Next scandal, Mr. Wise, how about being a little quicker off the mark?",0
26,"Kids love them!: I got a set of these for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. His 4-year old sister almost started fighting with him to play with them.Now that he has had them for a little more than a week, my daughter reports that he still spends hours building towers with them and then knocks the tower down, laughs and starts over again. Needless to say, she finds some of the parts in the oddest places after a ""knock down"".Both of the kids seem really amazed by the way magnets will stick together on one end and repel each other with the other end.I think this is a fantastic toy. Simple toys like this seem to be the most fun for kids and gives them a chance to use their imaginations.I recommend this toy highly. (even my 26-year old son and I had fun with them.)",1
27,Great book. The triumph of my reading life.: I thought that this book was the best dinosaur book I've ever read. Maybe one of the best books period,1
28,I remember when I had this..: I remember I was in the 9th grade I walked all the way to Bestbuy just to buy this album which the distance from Bestbuy to my place at the time was a very long walk. I was a big Limp Bizkit fan in my 8th grade year thought they were the best band out there. Now that I have grown up and look back it's like man how in the world can you like this stuff? It's just terrible.. I threw away this cd along with all my other Limp Bizkit cd's awhile back ago. Now I still like alittle bit of material off there first 2 albums I'm not going to lie there good songs when you want to listen to something just for the kick and that don't really mean anything. But the lyrics on most Limp Bizkit songs are just pointless and real childish it is pathetic. Well I didn't want to give this cd 1 star but I had to. to Do not get this CD if you must get something Limp Bizkit get Three Dollar Bill Or Significant Other but even those albums after awhile will start to become pointless.,0
29,"Efficiency at its best!: The first word that came to mind after watching this video was ""Wow!"" This video really highlights what an experienced and efficient carpenter can accomplish. These guys claim they can frame a house in two weeks. They were efficient almost to the point of being robotic. Small tap on a nail, then a single hit with the hammer and it goes all the way in.I have yet to see a contractor in Hawaii (especially with a crew of only two carpenters) accomplish that in less than two months.",1
30,"Not worth the money: 2007 Honda Odyssey in Syracuse, NY. I bought these when they were on sale and I had a rebate which ultimately made them 2-for-1 cost. At full price, I would have been resoundingly disappointed. The driver side wiper never makes complete contact with the windshield at slower speeds. From what I have read in hindsight, this is not uncommon. Would definitely buy the less expensive wiper blades and save the premium price.",0
31,"HORRIBLE BOOTLEG...KEEP AWAY!: This is a horrible bootleg edition with tacky art work of ""Carcel de Mujeres"" (Mexico 1951). The film itself is not bad and it boasts an excellent cast of female stars including Sarita Montiel, Katy Jurado, Emma Roldan, Miroslava and Maria Douglas among others. This DVD bootleg was done from a bad print of the film which is very dark, lacks sharpness and contrast plus there's noise in the soundtrack. Another insult to consumers who like films in Spanish. Keep away from it!",0
32,"It was 5 stars in '79!!: This album was far ahead of its time. The sound is exceptional & the writing superb. I cannot speak to the origins of Mr. Breant's talent but I must say that in 2004, I still look upon this work as something special.It's quite atmospheric, yet it engages those intested in the more technical aspects of music. Mr. Breant is a fine performer who found many interesting sounds & textures using the more ""primitive"" equipment available in the late '70's. The technical limitations are scarcely evident.Hats off to Francois Breant! I wish I could find more of your wrok.",1
33,"Too Many Errors: I am a homeschool mother. I have used both Traditional Logic I and II with my teenage daughter. I do not recommend these books for the parent who has never studied logic, especially as you proceed into the advanced book. The answer key has so many errors and typos. (Whole pages are missing.) that it is impossible to guide the child. It is also impossible to do this course without the DVD, even then Mr. Cothran does not shed much light on the subject in terms of practical application. I pray Mr. Cothran comes out with a second edition to clean up his errors.",0
34,"Western fan.: Hard not to like this packet if you like westerns.Even being B/W the picture was good.I did have to repeat a few times to get the wordsas sound went down but never so bad couldn't hear.Like most westerns don't always need the sound,the action tells all.",1
35,"It just does the job!: It is my third toothbrush. I bought this one because the old one does not have the stop every 30 sec function. With the new one, I can control my brushing time more conveniently. It also has a light to indicate when should I recharge the toothbrush and when it has done recharging.So far so good.",1
36,"Nice Coffee Maker: This is the second one I have had. The first one lasted 4 years and then the element burned out. It works well and as described. Coffee brews quickly and stays hot. I suggest using a regular pitcher to fill it rather than the one the coffee brews into because it is less likely to drip on the counter. the ""keep hot"" timer option and ""brew strength"" option are nice. Only complaint is that grounds sometimes collect on the inside of the lid and it needs to be cleaned off before brewing another batch.",1
37,"ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE: LA TRAVIATA is truly a movie-masterpiece. Brilliantly designed and flawlessly directed, this sumptuous production beautifully captures the grandeur of Romantic opera. Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo are perfect casting as Violetta and Alfredo. Highlights include ""Libiamo"" (""The Drinking Song""), ""Sempre Libera"" and ""Di Provenza"". As is the case with many great films, LA TRAVIATA seems to improve with each viwing.PLEASE NOTE: The chapter menu on the DVD edition of this film breaks the opera into four acts, when there are actually three.""Act Four"" should be Act III, and ""Act Three"" is really Act II Scene 2.",1
38,GOOD BOOK: This book contains one of the funniest lines I have ever read. Like all of Friedman's works - this book is great. But STERN is better.,1
39,Not as good as Garcia: This book is heavy on inspiration and light on details. I agree with the reviewer who preferred Garcia's _Sign with your Baby_ as being more complete and practical.,0
40,"Thank you!: The toy came well-packaged and still in its sealed plastic bag. Unfortunately, one of the eyes was loose, so I had to use some glue to remedy this. Otherwise it was in great condition, and was shipped to me in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the product and am glad BigZoo is selling such high quality (not to mention soft!) stuffed animals.",1
41,"Perfect fit: Love my dickies just what I was looking for durable, comfortable, and good fit ! Had all the colors I was looking for and at a fair price.",1
42,"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen: Hatchet by gary paulsen.I am doing this review for a book project in my english class. I picked this book because I always hear people talking about how good it is. So I decided to find out for myself weather it is good or not. I'm not really big on reading so not to many books intrest me but when I read the first page of this book it had my full attention and I did not want to put it down. The first chapter is full of action and excitement. Throughout this book a thirteen year old boy tries to survive with very few supplies. Luckly for him though it is summer and not winter. He has a hatchet that his mother gave him and a few more supplies from the plane.I'm not going to spoil the rest of the book for the people who have not read this action, thriller book. If you are reading this review and have not red this book I highly advise you to read this book.",1
43,"awful, horrible: This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is one of Shannon Tweed's first films. After this disaster, she would go on to become queen of the B-movie, which is why I expected a lot more from this. The acting is horrible, the ""special"" effects are even worse. The explosions, deaths, and general mayhem of a fire fight are poorly done repeatedly throughout the movie. Oh, the one [love] scene in the movie is hidden behind a rock! What's the frikkin' point of the NR rating!?!",0
44,"Lacking coherence: I read this book in anticipation of an upcoming trip to Peru. I hoped to gain some historical and cultural perspective to help me understand and appreciate the country. My goals were not met. Instead, I learned about injustice, corruption, prejudice, violence,and poverty. While I understand that these problems are real I didn't understand them in light of the history and development of the country of Peru. The author provides accounts of interviews and experiences in a haphazard manner with little contextual background or effort to pull them together in a coherent way. So, if your goals are similar to mine I would not recommend this book.",0
45,"Awful!: I ordered the product on 08/11, after a couple of calls to ""customer service"" and several unanswered emails I received the product 09/10. It was bent. I am returning product ASAP! I doubt I 'll order there again...worst customer service I have receiced in a while.",0
46,"Glad I Bought it used!: As far as racing games go, if you're REALLY bored then maybe it's worth the time to load into your PS2 (and wait for it to load). The simulation mode seems decent, with the ability to tweak your car though even that is limited. I was disappointed to find there was no pit stops. There are shortcuts, but I found them to only slow me down. The sub-games are fun, i.e. demolition. But whose idea was it to make a two sentance background music EVERY TIME the game loads? (sloooooowly) It was enough to make me want to strap m-80s to it and blow it to pieces. Do yourself a favor and turn the music(I use that term loosely) off. Would not recommend.",0
47,"Slave to Love: This is a dull, full-screen version of a 70s international thriller that might merit some attention if it looked better. It's pretty lame, but not really cheesy save for Ustinov's buffoonish clowning which belongs in a different picture. The great William Holden shows up for maybe a day's work -- he's supposed to be a cynical mercenary and crack helicopter pilot, but comes across more like a craggy old-timer going 40 in the fast lane oblivious to the fact that his turn signal's on. Much better is Rex Harrison turning in a tart cameo. He seems to have wondered in from a Graham Greene adaptation and he's welcome. Caine wears a Paddington Bear hat for the first third. You'll note his final confrontation with the villain of the piece is almost the same as in The Wilby Conspiracy.",0
48,"Delivered in poor condition: The dollhouse was very disappointing. It arrived with scratches, chips, dirt marks and some of the edges peeling. It is such a pity because I would not hesitate to recommend the dollhouse if the supplier could be trusted to deliver a product that did not appear to of been either used or left in storage for many years. It is reasonably well made, easy to put together and it has a lot of furniture. You can not do better for $90. So why didn't they send a set untouched, straight from the manufacture?",0
49,"not funny: I didn't find this book funny at all. ""A humorous romantic mystery"" didn't describe this book. Petty and mean was how the oldest sister treated the other 2. And where was the romance? Bad description all the way around.",0
50,Super dissapointed: Love these type of headphones.... But they are way too big for a womans ear.. They are huge and fall off if I turn my head. For bigger ears only. Sound quality decent.. if they stay in your ear long enough for you to hear them.,0
51,An Elm Creek Quilt Sampler: The First Three Novels in the series: The book was used. It was in good condition. The outside cover was missing and there were no marks in the book. The supplier was truthful about the product and the shippment was prompt. I would order from this vendor again.,1
52,"HOW CAN WE LOVE THE MUSIC WHEN ITS HORRIBLE??: Corey Clark is only an object of titillation for the masses who like people like him....(judging that the CD has bombed and that no radio stations are playing the single and that he has been dropped from the label). I am a disc jockey who will not play his music, not because of anything personal, but because if its not on the playlists, NO RADIO station is going to play the music! As I say, only the teeny boppers find this guy attractive...and the music....well, quite simply....its horrible. Get over the fact that your wonder boy has fizzled out and his fifteen minutes of fame are over. It has nothing to do with hate...it has to do with talent (or the lack thereof)!",0
53,"Great for 2 People: This product is great for the occasional snack, or extra side dish with dinner.The scooper, however, was a little skimpy (handle not long enough), but now I'm looking for a ""spider"" to use with it.Especially loved that you can just cover it, and re-use oil.Great product.",1
54,"Wonderful: Piers Anthony is a genius who writes delicious stories that are not only hilarious but thought provoking. ""The Source of Magic"" is superior to its predecessor, ""A Spell for Chameleon"", because of the endless conflicts throughout the novel. The images brought to mind when Bink and his companions begin to climb the constellations into the sky only to realize that they are really in a tree are so vivid that its mind boggling. I don't normally do spoilers here but suffice to say that this book is like a mental bacon cheesburger that will make you laugh and think at the same time. What a book!!! It reminds me of ""The Hobbit"" with its free-spirited jocularity and it delivers the same kind of satisfaction. Its a perfect book for young readers but old ones will devour it as well. After all, ""growing old is mandatory but growing up is optional"".",1
55,"THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!: Don't waste your money on this CD. If I could give this CD 0 star, I would. Sean Paul's voice is annoying, and he's just trying to be dope, but he ain't. The only good songs are Baby Boy and I'm Still in Love With You. (...)",0
56,"Vintage Lorca.: This book of Federico Garcia Lorca has given me hours of entertainment and enjoyment the past days. I enjoyed the poems so much I'm reading them for the second time. Lorca evokes Andalusian magic and Gypsy airs float in the air, makes one feel like visiting Granada and Andalusia. Now I need to get my hands on more Federico Garcia Lorca books.",1
57,"I was sent a blank mat: I received a blank door mat instead of the ""go away."" I was sad because now people keep visiting me!",0
58,"Grannys Only!: Oh my! I'm so glad I got this book on Amazon's Marketplace for $1.49 and didn't pay retail. If you're looking for knits for evening wear and you're under 70, skip this.Every women's pattern in here is odd looking and boxy and are things only an elderly woman can pull off. She harps on and on about NYC, etc. I'm sorry, I'm a Native NYer and I don't know any self respecting woman with even the smallest interest in fashion that would wear something in this book. Maybe the 90 year old grannies that only leave the house to go to charity events and are about 2 steps short of wearing their braziers on the outside of their clothing?Some of the children's patterns are cute, but again, uninspired.I would give my book away, but no one wants it. I'm VERY disappointed because I've heard such great things about Jil Eaton's children's patterns... I think maybe she should stick to designing for kids.",0
59,No good: It's great that HDMI cables are getting cheaper and cheaper. Unfortunately this one is too cheap. Or cheaply made anyway. I ordered this cable to connect my laptop to my AV receiver. The picture produced was distorted so bad I could sort of tell my desktop was up on the screen but everything was completely unviewable. I tried to connect direct to my TV and the picture cleared up slightly but not much.,0
60,"Very pleased: I purchased this knife a few weeks back. When I unpackaged the knife my first impression was just wow. For the price the knife is very sturdy the blade can be deployed in a very short amount of time, and it locks into position with a very satisfying click. My only true gripes are the clip which is already loose and the blade which came extremely dull (so much that even when I pushed down as hard as I could on a piece of cardboard it would NOT cut). Other than that I am extremely satisfied and would love to purchase another Smith & Wesson knife from this seller",1
61,"loved it: I wanted to see the next movie, and this was great. its weird seeing everyone old though. still love the guys.",1
62,He foresaw it wrong: I read this book some years ago . The analysis it gave of the impending death of the nation- state as central actor in political affairs has proven extremely premature.Brzezinski has a great knowledge of world affairs but somehow his perception is skewed. His writing style is also awkward and needlessly complicated.,0
63,"Not as bad as everyone says !: This changing table we did not have delivered we picked it up from a store location. The only semi problem was that the instructions were a little backwards , but once you get that figured out it is smooth sailing from there ... As far as another reviewer commenting on the pull out hamper drawer not being easy and requiring 2 hands to open, we do NOT have that problem at all ! Great find, Great price, and looks great !",1
64,"Overly commercial, bland, mediocre 'country pop'!: Listening to this CD all the way through was a very painful exercise. Our military should have used this Carrie Underwood CD to 'flush out' insurgents, not heavy metal! The music is way too commercial and boring to be taken seriously by any music lover with good taste. It is pathetic and sad how gullible the masses have become in accepting the contrived, overproduced pop stars of today, who clearly exist and are 'manufactured' by the greedy record companies to make them maximum dollars and profits. We are witnessing runaway greed and commercialism that is turning 'artists' into 'product' like never before!",0
65,"Twilight Zone Rocks!!!!: I finally completed my collection, I now have all Twilight Zone shows ever made, the all time best movie classics Rod Serling was way ahead of his time. Twilight Zone movies are a must see for all ages!!!!",1
66,"2 out of 3 damaged: Received the items promptly. Looked like they were properly packaged, but two out of the three had cracks on the clear plastic rim that goes around the top of the lantern. Also one of the switches only worked in one position (they are made to work to turn on whether your turn right or left). Called Amazon, very good response with them. They immediately issued me a full credit and I sent them back at their expense. Purchased a bit higher quality ones with no problem!",0
67,"Excellent!: This is really a super book! It is a simple yet great idea to be able to put your child's photo in the back and have her appear in all of the pictures. I really appreciated the fact that a child gets to be shown actually doing something--producing some action. The text was also well done. Luckily, it didn't come across as being too corny. A great book for baby and parents!",1
68,"Piece of Junk: I regret to say that this ""slim stylish player"" is the most disappointing electronic purchase I have ever made (and I've made a lot, trust me). In the two days I've had this, the file system has become corrupted twice, requiring me to re-install the drivers and update the firmware multiple times. Unfortunately, nothing has worked, and Creative's Support Site is worthless, since this item has not yet been added to the knowledge base.",0
69,Belt and Ice Bag needs redeign: Poorly made belt and the weight of the ice pack drops the ice bag after wearing. The fill cap on the ice bag should be in an upright or other location.,0
70,"Yes, i own it - but i'll soon get rid of it: Her sound is beautiful, surely because of that her fans will take this disc without any further question. Sorry, but her Falla is very imprecise of vowels and little notes, and in the lieder she sounds as if she does not have a clue of what she is saying. Undefined vowels again, wrong stresses and a vague sense of where the phrase is going. The more pretentious the cover, the harsher the criticism, i suppose.",0
71,Do not bother....: I could not finish this piece of trash. The dialogue was so bad that it made me laugh. How could this be published? Fifth graders can do better than this!,0
72,"Works Great But Has Proprietary FME Connector.: I tried a Wilson dual band magnet mount antenna #301103 but it wouldn't pick up any signal so I sent it back and bought this #301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. The first one must have been defective. The only drawback with this one is the cheap FME connectors that Wilson uses that break easily and are not compatible with anything else so you have to buy one of their special adapters or a pigtail with the correct ends on it to connect to your phone.Update, this antenna won't receive anything on the 1700Mhz band used by T-Mobile for ""4G"".",1
73,Love Deanna Durbin: If you like Deanna you will like this film. I hope they put all her movies on DVD. What a voice!,1
74,"Don't Waste Your Money or Time: Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table. You get what you pay for. No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard. The fence adjustment is LOUSY. One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design. Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other. The lightweight construction (cheap) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru...be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use. The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky. The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.In hindsight, I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment. Now I'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable.",0
75,"Too Long, Too Obvious: This book could have been much shorter and just as effective. The basic premise is obvious, but I suppose there are those out there that find it a ""revelation"". Suggest you get from the library instead of purchase.Is useful as a reminder as to what you should be doing, but low on practical ""how to"" applications.",0
76,"Ultimately flat and boring: While I agree with many reviewers that the subject matter is interesting and perhaps relevant to today, where women are stripped of rights in some places in the world, I did not like this book. As a result of her situation, Offred's character holds herself distant from the world around her. While a reasonable response to a screwed-up world, her narrating is just as distant and flat and I found myself not really caring what happened to her. The plot moved very slowly, and I wound up reading the plot synopsis on Wikipedia just to see if anything better is coming. It doesn't appear so, and so I'm not sure if I'll even bother with the last few chapters of the book.",0
77,Great pan: I've used it twice to boil soup and hot dogs. It heats evenly and cleanup was a breeze. The contemporary line seems to be better quality than the triply. My triply pan discolored on the bottom at the same temp but not this pan.,1
78,"Total junk: Firs of all I rarely write negative reviews, but this deserves it. I bought one of these, and within a week it stopped working. While it was working it was fine, but one day it just stopped working all together and the LCD went blank. I returned it, and got a new one, and the new one stopped working within 2 days. Same result. There no reason for the malfunction as it was being used to control a 25 watt light. The Non LCD one by timex worked for a month and stopped working properly (the time was always off, even when adjusted). Try to find a different brand timer",0
79,"Horrible: This product is so poorly done, it's hard to imagine that Bobbi Searle, anyone else, actually built this. The instructions are horrible. The material qualilty is abysmal. Even after several modifications and gluing and soldering (which are not supposed to be necesary) to get the thing to hold together, the final straw was that the motor is not powerful enough to operate the robot. I don't know who Bobbi Searle is, but I for one will know what name/author to avoid in the future. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS.",0

81,"Bad Girl Gone Worst: Rihanna isn't really a great singer, and you realize this quickly after watching her sing live again and again. I've never been a big fan of her music, but this album really just isn't cutting it. She is Pop/R&B for the moment, until someone else comes along as she came along on Christina Millian, Amerie, Kelly Rowland, & other singers. They all have the same bad break-up songs & happy make-up songs. I don't know what makes Rihanna so different or better than Kelly, Amerie, Christinia Millian or Ashanti.",0
82,"Does it get any better?: I won't make this lengthy. This is simply a fantastic collection of the best from Delirious, which just so happens to be the best from the modern worship scene. Those who already have every Delirious CD (like me) will still find this album fulfilling as it has a bunch of newly recorded favorites including remixes and new versions. Plus it contains a BRAND NEW song which is unbelievable! Buy this CD, while you're at it, buy another one for a friend.",1
83,"Is there a bad song on this CD?: Perhaps it is the exact moment this music came into my life, but it truly spoke to me, and all of my friends.

86,"Great Fiction, Nonfiction at its worst: Judith Reitman uses half-truths and hearsay to help create a panic involving a mythological pet theft ring that simply does not exist. Interview every dog researcher in the US and find that pets are too high strung to be research subjects. Even if pets were available as research subjects, they would not be suitable. Reitman uses ""facts"" from long ago to substantiate a supposed problem today. She warns to beware of the pet theft ring, when in fact you should beware of Judith Reitman.",0
87,"Unique models, vague instructions: This book has some of the most original models I've seen among origami books (including a particularly impressive clock). However, many of the instructions are vague or extremely difficult to fold as described. Some of the more advanced models will take lots of experimentation to figure out what the intended fold is.",1
88,"Great journey through the Energy Centers: I really enjoyed this book. The author, David Pond, clearly knows his subject and with ease takes you on a journey through each chakra. As well as giving the traditional vital statistics for each, he augments this information with psychological, emotional, and intuitive perspectives. Accompanying each section are exercises and meditations for nourishing and balancing these energy centers. This book is well integrated, clear, and elicits a strong sense of how important self knowledge of the chakras is to our individual vitality, our society, and our planet as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed the essays towards the end of the book. These tied it all together and gave perspectives on how chakra energy is utilized at every moment of every day, at every level of our being. This book made the chakras come alive for me. They are no longer just a great metaphysical idea, but an integral element of our process of being. Thank you, David. Good work.",1

I don't know if it's just me but this one seemed more cheesy than ever before, it even has the ketchup song! bah buuut it's ok really.",0
90,"Amazing flat iron!: I didn't buy mine from Amazon, but I figured a review would help anyone wondering if they should buy this flat iron. I've had mine for about 7 years now. I absolutely love this tool. I have thick, wavy hair, and this is the only flat iron that straightens my hair. It's never stopped working for me, the heat control is wonderful. I can straighten my hair on the lowest setting! It's very sturdy. I've straightened my hair every other day for the last 7 years with this tool, and I would never even think of using anything else. I would HIGHLY recommend this flat iron to anyone over and over again. It's wonderful!",1

95,"Excellent book for beginners and experienced photographers: De Couet and Green have done a tremendous work. Written in true textbook format, this is the perfect book for the intermediate and the advanced photographers. Beginners will like it as well but its sheer size might discourage inexperienced photographers. This is THE book any aspiring u/w photographer should have in his personal library.Jim Church's Nikonos System Handbook would be a comparable good choice for the beginners.A new edition is coming soon.",1
96,"The Trifecta: To truly appreciate Phillip Aaberg's music, you need to own his first three albums: this one, ""Out of the Frame"" and ""Upright."" This album was his debut, and is wistful yet melodic. My favourite song is ""Remembering This Place"" and all of the songs on this album have that kind of 'something is being lost here, and we need to recover it' feeling. It is a worthy purchase, and while it is not my number one Aaberg album, it is definately one of my faves.",1

103,"Not a how-to book: I was very interested in reading about a couple who took the plunge and homesteaded. I found the references to why they moved to the homestead interesting, but unfortunately, the rest of the book is interweaved with this philosophy as well as social issues. The practical is overshadowed or not explained in detail. The detail that is there focuses on what they did not how they did it. If you are looking for a how-to book, you should look elsewhere. I did find the section on health interesting and helpful. Also, the second section, ""Continuing the Good Life"" had some practical ideas on gardening. Overall the book was a disappointment, since I expected a how-to book not a philosophy book.",0

106,"Brockmann can do better: After anticipating the conclusion to the Sam and Alyssa story for the last five Seal Team 16 books, I was sorely disappointed in this book. There were too many story lines introduced that interfered with the flow of the main story. Only about 40 percent of the book were devoted to the main characters, very little of which is spent on romance or even true character building. Ms. Brockmann seems to have been more concerned with setting up her newest story line (a civilian, covert agency) than giving her readers what they have been expecting. The ending or HEA for these two characters was very rushed and not supported by the action in this book. After her dismal efforts in Into the Night, this is a second strike for Brockmann.",0

Possibly the most fabulous diving on Earth, at the price of wild, unpredictable currents in most places, and medical help at least 8 hours' away (time for a patrol boat to get to you from Sorong and take you back to the modest medical facilities there). Or you can watch this disk.This has none of the production razzamatazz of the IMAX movies--and none of the schmaltz.

Too bad, because it's a brilliant play and could be wonderfully and powerfully filmed - or, not.",0
116,"Book Still Gets Five Stars but One for Frey: When I read this book a year ago, I found some aspects either ridiculous or too vague, and I assumed he exaggerated but accepted that as artistic license. I felt sorry for the guy and admired his strength to recover. Now America feels duped. He was a frat boy! He goes around making the Oprah scene and further embellishing on the details in his speaking appearances, and it looks like his parents are in on the joke. Enabling parents... drug user.... hmmm I see a pattern here. If only he had presented it as fiction. I give it five stars because it's a damn entertaining book. But James Frey gets one star for integrity.",1

118,"What's the score?: A fantastic single from Sleater-Kinney. ""Get Up"" is one of the sexiest songs (really, just pay attention to the lyrics!) and ""By the Time You're Twenty-Five"" is an irresistable slab of, and I hate this term, pop-punk.However, the true gem of the single (and one of my five favourite Sleater-Kinney songs) is ""Tapping"". The opening guitar part is fantastic and it's a little different from the typical Sleater-Kinney track. Sort of epic... at least for the Kinney.",1
119,"Just the kind of short stories I always look for and rarely find: This is the best collection of short stories I've read in a long time! I love the style of writing---very straightforward but also with so much meaning in every paragraph. Lately it seems every piece of fiction I read is gimmacky in some way--constantly changing perspectives, flowery phrases--but this is real writing, about people in tough situations interacting, about generations relating, about sad memories, but always with a firm grasp of reality. By the first paragraph of each story I know the main characters! I think this author will go far, and I look forward to reading more by her.",1

121,"A Very TOUCHING Novel-Realistic!: This story would make someone cry when they read it. It is about a young girl whose mother is a poet, and yet dysfunctional in a lot of ways. When Ingrid, the mother loses control over a lover, killing him, she is sent to prison, and Astrid is sent from foster home to foster home.Some of these homes are terrible, and she experiences a lot of trouble with every one of them until she gets Claire as her third foster mother. This is a story in and of itself. She's in this home for awhile until something shattering happens to Claire who loves Astrid like her own. Astrid moves on to yet another home and this one is poverty-stricken. She is angry at her mother throughout the whole book for what her mother has put her through. And though she wants her mother's love deep down, she feels she can never have it. You must read further to see how the story turns out in the end, for I won't tell that part here. It is a very hard book to put down.",1
122,"Good info but too dry for me: This book is just as advertised but very boring to me. I was amazed by many of the little factoids sprinkled throughout the book. However, I quickly lost interest and never could bring myself to finish it. I think the information is valuable but I had a hard time staying intterested once I decided that I did not accept the authors definition of wealth. I found ""wealth"" in the authors view, to be very stringent and constricting and it flew in the face of one truly enjoying life. But if you are interested in seeing into the mind of an owner of local pizza shops, who drives the same car he drove in 1972, then this is the book for you.",0

125,"Several Hoodoos harmed in the making of this CD: I rushed out to buy this after reading Entertainment Weekly's glowing review, which dropped all the references you'd want to hear -- Ramones, Chuck Berry, Johnny Thunders, Replacements, Cheap Trick.Sadly, the album is flat-out awful. Sure, it's jam-packed with musical nods to all of above, but this record is surprisingly devoid of any real hooks.It's really got an identity crisis. Is it power pop? Not melodic or catchy enough. Is it punk? Uh, no attitude. Does it rock? It's actually kinda wimpy. Loud guitars and over-production doesn't guarantee you that your band will ROCK.Maybe these guys are OK in concert, but this record is going nowhere. They're young, so they may very well improve in time.From track 1, I didn't like the album, but I really lost it when they butchered the Hoodoo Gurus' best song. Ugh!",0
126,"Window into another world...: that looks a lot like this one. A good movie, like a good novel, takes you into the world of the character. You walk a mile in his shoes. You develop empathy. That is absolutely what happens in this amazing film. This is not a ""Hollywood"" version ""based on a true story"". You watch the story unfold in real life, with real people - amazingly ordinary people who offer a glimpse of their extraordinary souls. You get to know their everyday lives, their joys, and ultimately the sorrow that they are moving toward in this period of their lives. My one complaint is that the editing is a little lax on the central character. Perhaps the film maker could not bear to take more away from a man who was losing so much already. The transsexualism here is appropriately handled as an aside. It does not define the story or the people. This is a tragic story of injustice that nonetheless reveals the power of unconditional love and acceptance, and the triumph of the human spirit.",1
127,"Just OK: If this book had been printed in standard font without whole page line drawings, it wouldn't be much more than a pamphlet. The stories were OK, but too simplistic (some only 1-2 pages long). Check out some other Native American folklore books before you buy this one.",0

131,The Historian: I dont understand what all the hype is about. I found the book fairly tedious and stilted because it is just too long.

The theory of striking pressure points on the body is nice and when done systematicaly with a cooperative person it looks good to,but I see little real practicle value in this book,the problem for me is Dillman claims that this is real self defence, well if he can hit someones arm or leg in a concise point against an opponent who wants to tear his face off I mean a real fighter then I stand corrected but I`m yet to see someone use a pressure point strike in a real spontaineous situation.

This film does not meet up in visual standards to or have the story coherence of the regular TV series. The fades between scenes were amateurish, the editing disjointed and I wanted to fire the cinematographer.

I prefer to work out with an instructor my age with a charasmatic personality and a body that I wish I had. I sooo did not get my needs met with this lame dvd.

If I lived in those areas I would go for a ""Thrower"". In heavy drifts when used as a shovel it works great.

I remember when I saw them for the first time...I had never even heard of them. By the end of their set, my jaw was to the ground and I knew I had experienced a band that would definitely not just be a flash in the pan. Finally, they release this LP and I never would have doubted that they would make it this far! Till We Have Faces contains an awesome array of drumming as well as guitars which can drive hard or even sing a sweet lullaby. The vocals are filled with emotion. All of them combine to show the energy that makes up Noise Ratchet. All the traks are incredible, but some of my favorites are For You I'll Be Forgetting Me, End and Disappear. Get this CD you won't be dissapointed! And also if you get a chance see them live because their shows are more incredible than the cd even!!!!!!",1

172,"Under The Radar: Ann G. was an r&b singer that came out in the late 80's and followed up her intial success with this sophomore project. This album showcased her singing/songwriting/production talents throughout the eight featured tracks. The album flows from beginning to end. ""Get A Life"" jumpstarts the project with it's parliment/funkadelic sample in the mix. This song is giving a message that people should mind their business. Other message songs include ""I Can't Get With It"" and ""Love Me Just For Me."" The first is about a friend that is into things that may not be the best for Ann G. She sings the song soulfully and non judgmentally but with a very balanced viewpoint, the later song speaks for itself-a love song about an individual being loved from the heart internally. Like the other reviews mentioned, this album was a more mature effort than the first. It's hard to believe that a woman with this much talent didn't get the props she really deserved. She fell under the radar.",1

177,"Great Vocalist: I think that this is a great album, she makes a true turn around with the diversity on this LP. She gives us more than just hits, she gives us the meat of what she can really do. I believe she is very underrated, her voice is unlike any other out here right now. She definitely can give Beyonce a run for her money with her vocals, and she definitely puts Ashanti in the dog house. I think that she just needs a better marketing team on her side, she definitely has a fan base, but you are not told when her albums are being released.The best songs in my opinion are:HypnoticHe Makes Me Say (reminds you of old school jams)Classic Love Song (reminds you of A.Keys You Don't Know My Name)Phone SexSlowlyAnother Relationship ( Classic Syleena cut)Leave Me AloneOnly A WomanI think she doesn't get her props the way she should.

Kelley's peppy diatribe is not light, 600 odd pages or so can be unkind to your hernia, but her fast-paced writing style helps, although it gets a bit 'Maxim' on occasion for my taste.Great read. Since you're here, also recommended: American Dynasty by Kevin Phillips.",1

Maybe it will grow on me.""The Morning Fog"" has a very upbeat quality that none of the other songs really have and ""Hello Earth"" has some great vocal layering going on.Overall, I find this album outstanding. Perhaps with more listens I will love it even more!",1
190,"well paced character drama: This is another Jack Webb film. He and a long list of reasonably well known actors recreate the night shift at a major city newspaper in the 1960s. The pace of the film is very fast which plays into the speed of the news. The script weaves all sorts of stories and characters together in a very good way. It uses the news stories to introduce all sorts of characters who come on screen and then are gone. Its much more light-hearted (with some exceptions) than Webb's usual fare.As with most of Webb's work, the film is obsessed with re-creation, detail and human interest stories. The technical people working at the newspaper even get covered (which I can't ever remember another film doing). William Conrad gives a good performance running the newsroom. It would have been better if the story had gone beyond the newsroom to see various people at work. But its still not a bad little movie from that era.",1

When it arrived I was shocked, these pans are so nice! I have cooked popcorn in the 8 quart covered pan and cooked several sausage and egg combinations in the 10 inch fry pan. I wish manufactures would realize some of us like having lids for our frypans too, but I always improvise with either a splash screen or a non fitting lid from some other pan. Other than that these pans are well worth the money. I read a review about the handles bending easily?

Browsing and leafing through in the book is somewhat awkward. The biggest negative, and it is a big one, is the dingy gray screen.

The second half of the book is centered mainly on Jim's long affair with Kate, Jules' wife. Jules completely approves of and even facilitates their relationship, so there's really no conflict there. The conflict comes from their innumerable break ups and reconciliations. When I say innumerable, I mean it. After a point I found myself not really caring whether they stayed together or not, but just praying for the relationship to be resolved one way or another so that the descriptions of their silly, melodramatic fights would end. The book is kind of interesting in terms of its style and its commentary on social and moral values in early 20th century Europe, but overall I found it a bit of a bore.",0

210,"Stay Away: I too was interested in a cheap sub, and this seemed to fit the bill. I read about the farting noise when it went into sleep mode, and figured I could live with it. Well, maybe, but that's not the only issue I had.The amp has two switch positions: ""off"" and ""auto"". It does not have an ""always on"" position, and this is a critical failure. At certain volumes, the auto-sensing ""feature"" will put the sub into power-save mode mid-song, overlaying the fart noise on top of the music. At this point, there's no bass, until the volume gets turned up, it senses the signal again, and it kicks back on.In songs with quiet periods, or movies where explosions alternate with dialog, the sub turned itself on and off way too often - it was completely intolerable. I could hear a bass line, then it would be gone, replaced with the fart noise.If you're cranking repetative industrial or techno, you won't have this problem, but users with other applications in mind should pony up an extra $23 for a better sub.",0

It started out with a twist, she wants to hire a killer, but for herself, not for someone else. The author did not throw in a lot of sex scenes to make this story fly and move. The story inside the story is a really enjoyably orginial touch. The ending was not the run of the mill ending either. If you are looking for that little something different and a change of pace, I think that you will enjoy this book. Pick it up and enjoy.!!!",1

234,"Strictly for novices: This book is VERY basic. It is written for people who have never used Paint Shop Pro and may be intimidated by the manual that comes with the program. If you want to improve your existing basic skills, this is NOT the book for you! As soon as I opened the book, I realized I made a mistake in buying it. As an example, on page 136, ""Adjustment layers are beyond the scope of this book and will not be addressed."" Chapter 10 on masks starts by saying, ""Masking is probably one of the most powerful features of Paint Shop Pro."", yet the chapter describes only how to create a mask from a ""canned"" geometric shape. There is no instruction for how to create a mask from an imported graphic or an outline from a photo...which I want to do. I also expected instruction on blending several photos together (to make panoramas), but this is not covered at all.On balance, this book is a big disappointment and I wish I'd had a chance to look inside before buying it!",0

236,"the best local study of the civil rights movement.: Rabby has done a wonderful job capturing the essence of the civil rights struggle on the local level. She has the full cast of characters: impatient students, anxious elders, foot-dragging whites,mean-spirited judges, foolish community leaders, and violent racists.What makes this book so good, so essential is the humanity, the people who led and bled to advance the movement in Tallahassee and the nation, to make America live up to its promise of freedodm and equality.In the end, Rabby restastes with passion and eloquence an essential truth of the civil rights movement--it was a daily struggle carried forth by ordinary people cast into extrordinay circumstances by their courage and determination.Read this book if you want to appreciate America at her best.",1

238,"Fine for Bedford fans.: Though fairly new to SF I've read a lot of Benfordover the last year. This book though enjoyable is not up to the standard of works like Timescape or Across the Sea of Suns. The plot is somewhat confused beginning with the sort 'War In Space' I associate with the chessy SF I knew in my teen years. Then it branches off into broader notions of cosmology first explored in the Galactic Centre series and mixes in a love triangle in which 2 of the parties are different representations of the same personA good read. If you enjoy Benford as I do, I think it's worthwhile",1

These lyrical geniuses as they are so often described are so soley because half-wits give meaning to their nonsensical lyrics. It's kind of the magic eye of musical lyrics. If you listen long enough and ingest enough dope maybe you'll find meaning in their words after awhile. That nursery rhyme entitled rocky raccoon should be renamed "" The Curious George Goes to the Saloon Rag"". But if ever notice, beatles fans are the same sheep that make it necessary for fast food joints to offer value meals. Simply, they need to have someone else decide what would be good to eat.

243,"Outstanding Introduction to Index funds: A great introduction to index funds. Two other texts that complement this book are John Bogle's ""Bogle on Mutual Funds"" and the seminal ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Burton Malkiel. The case against actively managed mutual (or pension) funds is persuasively presented by any of these three but the Tweddell/Pierce treatment is more practical. The only criticism is that its list of index funds is already out of date. Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, etc. have recently joined the fray and some funds have closed",1

It took me two months just to force myself through half the book. Now, knowing it doesn't get any better, I'm going to put it back on the exchange shelf--with a warning note! Avoid it!",0
245,"Foreign service diplomats?: I have the CD version of this course, and although I did not pay full price, it was still too expensive considering the content. The repetition is helpful for pronunciation, but the same sentences are repeated over and over in every exercise ... so you walk away knowing how to say three sentences in varying forms, with little useful vocabulary.In addition, the recording quality is quite low, with other conversations often audible in the background of the dialogue and a constant hiss.While perhaps a passable foundation for someone with time to spend, it is certainly not the best course to prepare you to travel in France. At the least, it would need to be combined with a course that teaches some minimal vocabulary useful for travel situations. I just returned from several days in Paris, and found myself essentially dependent upon sign language, even after completing 10 of the 13 CDs in the set.",0

248,"~I LOVED THIS BOOK!!~: Donna Hill never lets her readers down. 'Indiscretions' has it all, mystery, romance, and a passion to die for. As a successful attorney, Khendra Phillips faces the hardest trial of her career when she is asked to defend the man that she loves, Sean Michaels. Even though Khendra knows in her heart that Sean is innocent of murder, she still can't find it in her heart to trust him after he takes the promotion in the law firm that she was expecting to get. Sean Michaels is also a succesful attorney with a few secrets in his past that come back to haunt him. The one thing that he doesn't keep a secret is his feelings for Khendra. He is determined to do whatever it takes to win her back.This book was too good to put down. Don't think about starting it unless you have time to finish, you will not want to put it down either. The passion alone makes this book a keeper. If you enjoy this, try and find a copy of 'Rooms of the Heart' also by Donna Hill.",1
249,"Nice if it continued to work.: I will start out by saying that I loved this DVD player. It did everything I wanted it to do and di it very well. No complaints on the actual performance. My 1 star is because I have owned two of them already and they have both given ""H02"" errors which, from my understanding, means they need a new laser which is about $90. They both failed after the warranty period. It starts at digitized boxes happening during DVD play (have cleaning products for the player and the DVDs) and soon progresses into ruined machine. So now my second failed with the same error and I can't bring myself to get it fixed or get another for fear of a threepeat.",0

Just order from a reputable company that assures you you receive your order.",0
251,"I can see effects within the first few days of trying it!: To all of you who may be a bit skeptical,It worked for me within 3 days of completing the book. First example, I enjoyed reading Michael Crichton's Timeline with the system. It felt like watching a movie, only better! I read the 400+ book in 5 days, with Photoreading and previewing.Second example, I PhotoRead a book entitled ""Parallel Universes"" and the next evening, I began to get these new ideas about Quantum Physics that I've never even thought of before (of course, I've had some background knowledge). True enough, when I returned to the book, those ideas that came into my head were really inspired from the book which I PhotoRead.So I urge you budding PhotoReaders out there to have faith. A true genius is one who possesses deferred gratification.",1

If you can get your car seat installed by a certified tech, that's great and it's the way to go. BUT my son's car seat is quite often going back and forth between our car and Grandma's car for Grandma-Fun-Days. Are we going to go to a tech every time we move the car seat back and forth?! Yeah, right. The Mighty-Tite is the ONLY reason I feel that my son is safe in my mom's car. I get it in there SO tight every time, and really quickly, too.

The print server in addition to the wired and wireless router functions is of tremendous use to us.Unfortunately instant messaging voice conversations don't work over this device, even when using the DMZ and trying to open holes in the firewall as described by SMC tech support. SMC has also been very latent in getting new firmware out for it.It has also proved unstable and sometimes slow when using the MAC address filtering features. Security is also somewhat flaky. In short, for a basic, unsecured wireless/wired router and print server it is tolerably reliable. If you want voice chats or rock solid reliability, however, I'd look elsewhere. Linksys tends to be more standards compliant.",0

To become involved in a story & there is no ending is depressing enough but there also is no beginning & a real lack of character development.

It's loud enough to wake people up in a small apartment.I called the Breville customer service line and they said there was nothing I could do about it. They would not register my complaint either.For 119.00$ this is completely unacceptable. A shame because it really is a nice toaster. If you are deaf, I would recommend it.

When Phoenix's character fights his first fire it was just like what all firefighters experience. As a firefighter I noticed a few technical errors but I'm sure they happened to make the movie flow a little easier. Nothing major, like where they parked one of the engines was bit too close to the fire, and I was taught to never give your breathing apparatus to a victim (they may fight you to keep it).

The hot joints are Dogs Out, Get It On The Floor,The Intro, and the track after that. Untouchables was cool too. For some to call themselves DMX fans ,they are not standing behind this album.

264,"Tragicomic, minus the comic: I love the work of David Sedaris and similar 'tragicomic' authors and memoirists. We can find in their brave ability to laugh at the horror of what they've endured, some hopeful statement about the absurd nature of the human condition.I read this book in one sitting and, having done so, I didn't feel a bit like ""wow that's some zany stuff"" rather i felt very sad. Forced attentions from a man double his age, dropping out of school, tons of cigarettes, examination of feces -- it was simply too believable, too real, too harsh.So, in this, I say this is a tragic book told with a survival-required sense of detachment, it's not detached because it's funny, it's detached because the world is so cruel.That said, for other survivors of abuse this may be a great read to find a kindred spirit.",0

Then one night it was on tv and I was like, what the hell,I was bored so I figured why not?! Well, by the end of the movie I was in tears because I was so moved. I can't explain exactly what it is I liked about it. It was a simple movie...and yet so touching. It had alittle bit of romance, alittle bit of comedy, and it felt so real. I was also very impressed w/ the movie's soundtrack, so much so that I now intend to buy the cd! I would highly recommend this movie! Even my husband ended up watching it with me and enjoying it.",1

Why give us exercises covering theorems that the book may not have even addressed. At a minimum, anything that is educational should be helpful.",0
269,"A Shining Day: The music for this movie was designed, I think, to show Doris Day at her best. Other collections of her vocals, such as Complete Recordings with Les Brown, fail to showcase Ms. Day's remarkable range, and also fail to show her contrasting styles. In the movie, Ms. Day's character, Ruth Etting, is hardly happy and the mournful tunes Ms. Day sings do justice to Ruth's sad life. But, wonder of wonders, when Ms. Day sings ""At Sundown,"" the kind of perky, peppy tune everyone associates with her, she delivers the song so effortlessly and beautifully that you wish Ruth had never lived an unhappy moment.",1

Of all of Fred Astaire's dancing partners Ms. Powell is by far the best match. In this film the two greatest dancers in history give the world a film to remember, which sadly has been forgotten. The film includes a wonderful Cole Proter score with the songs ""Please Don't Monkey With Broadway"" and ""I've Got My Eyes on You"". Astaire and partner played by George Murphy are dancers looking to hit the big time in New York, and Powell is the Broadway star they both fall in love with.

What good is it if you have to get another can opener?Even when it does open cans, it is not the most user-friendly can opener I've had (and I've only had two cheap ones ever before, haha).

Moreover, Kay's prose occasionally reaches a level where, as the reader, I have had to pause, put the book down, and savor both the beauty of the language he has employed, and the insight I have gained into life, love and faith.

This device shows plenty on it's digital display, but the holder is poorly designed and in the 5 days since i have had it, it has fallen off my belt twice. the company provides a tether for the unit that you can clip to your pocket in case it falls off, but to me that is a band-aid and a bad one at that. the holder plan and simple should have a deep enough clip to sit over your belt or pocket instead of on top of it. that would minimize the danger of losing it. also, it comes with the tether which didn't seem clear since amazon noted that others bought a tether available separately (as did I only to find out i didn't need it since one was in the box).",0

The Enterprise is captured by an alien species the Denari and only Trip and Hoshi escape and are rescued buy some other Denari who are fighting the ones who took the Enterprise. This is set against a back drop of the flight of an earier than Enterprise starship Daedalus that exploded on its maiden voyage some 15 years before. The story has an interesting twist at the end.

296,"Konami FAILED HARD on this one. =/: Really, this is a good Game, but the only real reason why I Bought it was for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, it was my most Favorite Game when I was Little and unfotunatly, I have Lost my Copy for the PS1. Now, I know from Reviews that they Changed the Voiceovers and such, but Seriously? They don't even Sound right, and they Changed all of the dioalogue! I'm honestly not going to buy another Castlevania Game unless it's the Original, because I Wasted $20 on a Game that I probably won't even Play now, thank god I Bought FFVII:Crysis Core when I bought this. =/Pros: If you like Castlevania's that're Sidescrollers you're going to Like this game and it's Graphics are a bit Vamped. (No Pun intended.)Cons: Castlevania Symphony of the Night was completely Changed, there's no reason for it, Konami can and should Shove it where the Sun doesn't Shine. =/",0

299,"Two Stars: Despite a few genuinely lovely moments, I only gave Jazz Mandolin Project two stars. Jazz at its best lays bare the soul of the instrument. This cd utterly failed to do that. List of other complaints: 1) use of an electric mandolin on some songs, 2) very little tremolo, 3) inclusion of live versions of two songs already included as studio recordings, 4) at times too noisy, 5) most of the loveliest moments almost too quiet to hear. This is my least favorite of my nine mandolin cds, and perhaps my least favorite jazz cd as well.",0
300,"Jeff Dunham disappointed: We have several of Jeff Dunham's tapes and they are hilarious. This one was more blue (more foul language) than before, and far too many racist overtones for your liking. It simply wasn't very funny. Wish I had saved my money instead.",0

302,"the best joke book ever!!: The Pretty Good Joke Book is the best joke book I've yet come across! I especially like its variety. It has some cute classics and some funny modern jokes. It includes yo mamas, bar jokes, regional jokes, kids jokes, musical jokes, occupational jokes, gender jokes, old people jokes, a few dirty jokes for adults...and much, much more! Also, it's not like one of those joke books where once you read all the jokes you toss it aside. Nope, with TPGJB, it seems that every time I read it, I come across new jokes that I haven't read yet, and, it's always fun to chuckle at a joke I've read before. One read of this book and you're sure to be the clown/comic of your community!",1
303,At least it's consistent: We have had the same problems other reviewers reported. The caller ID stopped working first after about 6 months. We were unplugging to reset it several times a day. Then even answering the phone became hit and miss. The one good thing is that the manufacturer replaced it with no hassle. So far it has been another 8 months and the caller ID has only gone out 3-4 times in the past couple months. But the volume is not good (I'm constantly asking callers to repeat themselves) and it clicks all the time which is very annoying. We have just replaced it with a phone that got great reviews. I am hoping it works much better than this one.,0
304,"Why, why does Pavarotti do this to his career?: Why would a singer that had some great, even some monumental recordings under his belt (Fille du Regiment) do something like this? Oh, I know, money.Luciano Pavarotti was blessed with a great voice, but NOT a voice for singing Calaf. If you want to know how Puccini wanted his Calaf to sound find a recording of Giacomo Lauri Volpi or one of Franco Corelli. Fleta did the opening night of this Puccini's swan song, but he was wise enough not to sing it again (no recordings of Fleta on this role are available); I wish Pavarotti and other singers would have learned a lesson from Miguel Fleta.",0

310,"works great! unless you want to cook with it.: What is the point of a food processor that only works if you first chop the vegetables into small uniform pieces? It is easier, cheaper, faster, and you get a better result if you just finish the job yourself with a knife and cutting board. I thought that this would work like a mini version of our other cuisinart food processor but its more like the toy model version. It looks great, but don't try to actually cook with it.",0
311,"America what is not wrong: In this book Barlett and Steele paint a bleak outlook for the dwindling middle class. Due to government manipulating and corporations leaving America the middle class will soon die out. Writen from one-side of the issue and concetrating on individuals the book does not give an acurate portrail of life in America. The myopic view of this book looks past all the new jobs being created in other feilds as manufacturing jobs move away. Also overlooked is the freedom in the system, who wants to give up their rights so things can be more fair.",0
312,Amazing!: This set is comparable to Uchida's famous set of Mozart piano sonatas on Phillips with much better sound!(not so dry like Uchida's set but with hall ambience/reverebance) I bought this because of J. Morrison's review and completely concur with his sentiments. Great purchase.,1

Straight out of the package and no video or sound from my PS3. Tried my other cables that I had taken off of my DVD player and the PS3 worked fantastic. I guess I can use the 10 ft cables as a jump rope or something, cause they aren't worth a dime to me for viewing my gaming system. Don't waist any of your hard earned money on this product.

314,"Not real happy with this one: This cover has the vents over the side tables(don't believe the picture on the box or in the ads) which makes it a little silly if you live where it rains, or snows, or dust blows.

318,"Expensive... maybe, but it works!: I purchased this coupler/repeater when several of my x.10 devices started to become unresponsive. The coupler I previously had been discontinued. I didn't see why I needed LEDs, but it was about the only game in town. I bought it and it didn't help. With some further investigation (reading HomeSeer logs) I discovered a lot of J Status commands. It turns out I had a ""line noise"" problem. While the Siglalinc Repeater wasn't designed to be a line analyzer, the red LEDs showed me a lot of information. Among other things, it showed me which 110 phase the problem was on. I then just started unplugging things and walking back to the Signalinc to see if the problem was gone. My problem was an AC to DC wall converter... 9vdc output. Oh and while this is expensive as a coupler, it is dirt cheap as a coupler/amplifier/analyzer. JR",1
319,"A Difficult Subject Nimbly Depicted, Fluid Reading: Gregg Olsen has taken this controversial subject and through research and removal of personal bias, presented Mary Letourneau as a gifted,loving human being. It is after this foundation is laid that each bullet along the chain of demise is introduced and this American tragedy is then opened for the reader to evualate with scientific knowledge as well as a compassionate understanding of how such a tragedy could be perhaps, not such an isolated occurence. The reading is fast, moving & rivoting. The subject reallys encroaches upon your soul and will leave you emotionally challenged.",1

326,"I don't buy this.: I can sum this all up for you with one simple fact: Bart Sibrel is living proof that he himself is a liar. Because, if the US government really was anywhere near as corrupted as Mr. Sibrel would have you believe and if he really did have the proof that would be required to expose a conspiracy of this level, as he claims that he does, then he simply would not be alive today. He would have been ""taken out"" a long time ago by government assassins. And he certainly would not be allowed to sell any of his atrocious DVDs on the open market. Bart Sibrel is a con-artist, plain and simple, and not a very good one at that. The main content of his films is property of NASA and like all NASA materials they are already in the public domain, i.e. you can watch them for free. If you're American your taxes have already paid for these videos. Bart is asking you to buy something that you already own! If you're smart you won't waste your money on this scam.",0

332,"Bump To The Funk: Putting things in context, you could compartmentalize ""The Twist"" as being BIG BIG in the early 60s, and then disco came along in the ~ mid 70s. That left a lot of years in between, roughly from 1963-1974. ""Tighten Up"" is likely the most easily recognizable dance tune from that whole period.Yes it's ironic & sad that the song was released in early April, 1968; that being said perhaps one can remember it as the tune that kept us along going & dancing during that period. I certainly do. I can't possibly remember how many times I got together with a group of kids & just danced away, and let all the troubles & injustices of the world melt away.Additionally, this song introduced the ""funk sound"" that became so prevalent particularly from about 1968- 1973. Then came disco. Enough said!!",1

I bought it and we have had a wonderful time together reading it. She is so fascinated by all these dinosaurs and I have to compliment Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Olshevsky for the way they have made the world of dinosaurs accessible to kids--especially kids with learning disabilities. We have had the best time looking at the art and reading the text. This is a truly beautiful book! Thank you so much!",1
334,"Good Bye Lenin: It was very interesting to see how the family felt about the old regime and how the mother should not know about the fall of the wall because she was recovering from a heart attack. It was heartwarming to see the kids go to great length to restore the apartment the way it was in the old DDR, and yes, many people just got rid of their old stuff and bought new things to start a new life. It was touching when the mother saw the statue of Lenin ""float"" above her head to be discarded. It's very worthwhile watching and my ""East German"" relatives felt that it was the way it was.",1

They were a little wary at the start, but the first chapter had them cracking up so loud they disturbed the other classes. I've read plenty of reviews that said ""I laughed so hard I was in tears"", but never really believed them--but this happened to me. The structure of one amusing anectdote after another really lends itself well to a read aloud format (though watch out for some minor expletives). I do realize that the book is not all laughs, but I am curious to see how Mr. Curtis handles the tragic events in Birmingham and how my students will respond. I look forward to the discussion that this should create.",1

This was an author I would automatically buy as soon as her books came out and I feel almost tricked. This was not a romance. The hero and heroine have about 5 pages of actual dialogue together.

348,"Goetterdaemerung for a Great Biographer: I was initially angry at the prospect of reading this little work -- written in Manchester's seventieth year -- rather than a third and concluding volume of his monumental Churchill biography. Alas, the word is now out that there will be no third volume -- that the author lacks the will or capacity to carry on.Manchester -- together with Catherine Drinker Bowen -- is clearly the great biographer of the century. His passing from active work is a deep personal blow to one who has savored his work for more than thirty years.This ersatz volume I found to my delight to be highly engaging and insightful into the Age of Gutenberg and Michaelangelo, of DaVinci and Tyndale. This book is in the best tradition of Will Durant -- a great writer who doesn't plow new ground but places the mountain of existing literature into a context and framework.",1

Plus, the European version comes with the song Waterloo which is not on U.S. Version! And, to get all songs, we must fight for a limited 2CD set containing the complete tracklist plus an unplugged song.

A good editor would have simply cut 150 or so pages from this 497 page, inflated novel, removed much of the repetitive and boring descriptions of the land, lay bare the plot, challenge the writer to improve the plot and add more characterization.

Love the extension and that they have a clip and handle and they are easy to use without the handles. They can be hooked around hooks to use that way and they strength is super. Great job Black Mountain brothers.",1
372,Slime 1 Gallon: I purchased one gallon of slime to use with my Polaris Sportsman. Buying it by the gallon was the right decision and it was priced right.,1
373,Worthless: I had to throw the product away. It is difficult at best to operate. I had a Royal typewriter in college. This one was useless. My wife is disabled and it requires so much finger pressure to operate the keys that she was unable to type anything. Also the letter registration is so poor that there are fuzzy lines around each letter no matter how hard or softly you press the keys. I wish I had known in advance that the new version of the Royal manual typewriter is a toy and not a real typewriter.,0
374,"Does Not Last an Hour: From the manufacturer, ""60 seconds of winding for 1 hour of light"". This is patently false. If you turn on the light and wind it while using it, I suppose it could, also it's a lot brighter when winding it. As soon as you stop winding it gets a lot less bright and in about 2 minutes becomes so dim that it isn't very useful for any real purpose.I suppose if you want a light that you can count on for a mad max post-apocalyptic world where there is no more power and no more batteries, this would be your only real choice. I have the light for 2 years now and it still works, even with kids using it as a child's toy, so I'd say it's durable. But as you can see, we just let the kids play with it as it not very useful.",0
375,"NEXT!: Got this book as an extra resource for my organic chemistry class. It turned out not to be useful at all. First, it is kind of a very old version of organic chemistry and second every time I try to work with this book it has so much dust that I started to sneeze.Content. Well, it has a way of explaining basic concepts of the class. Yet I recommend to buy a more recent version of the book.",0

377,Collectible for all E-Street Band fans: While there are only 4 songs on this CD it does have two live versions you won't find anywhere else. Great collectible for any E-Street Band fans. Just being able to hear The Big Man again made it worth it for me.,1
378,"OK...but not that great: I live in Washington state in an area where the humidity is about 45-50%. Therefore a evaporative cooler should work great. WELL...the instructions are fun to read, seriously they arent exactly useful but good for a laugh.PROS: Fan works great. I like the timer/sleep features its not extremly noisyCONS: doesnt cool very much even with ice in the water(that i kept in the fridge) and in the upper comparment i think this is because the mesh is uses is very much like that of a laundry bag not thick enough to absorb much water. The indicator lights are bright enough to be a night lite.Overall, if you want a fan with a bit of humidity this is your thing. If you want something to actually cool a room or space of any kind. You should get an air conditioner.",0
379,childrens books: This book is beautifully illustrated. The poetic language tells a biblical accounting of man choosing names for different animals. As an added activity there is a list of animals hidden in the illustrations that older children will enjoy seeking out. It comes with a CD of Bob Dylans recitation of the story. It's a book that every home library should treasure.,1

382,"good book, needs editing: Ok, I really liked this book. It could tone it down a little (or a lot) on the sex, because it's beginning to get to the point where plot is just an interlude between sex acts with random people. Also, who edited this book? Does anyone realize that halfway through the book, Hamilton changed the spelling of Jason's last name? Also, she needs to work on her comma usage and occasional sentence structure. It was yet another distraction from the plot. I don't remember the other books being like this. I love the series, but this book needs some work.",1

384,"one of the best gay romantic film!: The first time i saw the movie years ago, i fell in love with it. The story was simple yet very powerful and theres a lot of symbolism in the movie. The acting is very natural and if their story happens to me, i might do and feel the same thing as what Wei does. I love the cell phone scene where they exchange I love you to each other. That was very romantic! I cant wait for this dvd version to be released.",1

389,"Phenomenal!: I picked this book up at random, and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I really enjoyed the confusion of who was narrating which book and when. One was never quite sure if it was Nevada or Clair who controlled the text in the reader's hand. And what an imagination on Linde! If one could get past the implausible nature of Nevada's sculpture, a living ecosystem encompassed in an artwork that was a refuge from reality was an ingenious idea (especially in Nevada's state of mind).Not to mention the deeper meaning of the book which hits home with many women- codependency. It is evil and it is real, and this was a wonderful depiction of women working through their emotional battles on their own ground.",1
390,Surrealistic and different from the standard: This is like some sort of computer animation demo. Movement and images are not realistic but surrealistic. Most of the visual effects have been improved in recent fantasy movies because this gate was made in 1994. Five years are an eternity in computer related issues. In less than 1 year you must upgrade or you will have a train in a formula 1 contest.However it has good arts and it is different from the standard.,1

396,"Fascinating Book!: This book, based on a real story, has turned out to be one of my favorite books to read. The author, Louis Lenski, made this book so descriptive, that I felt as if I was in the book myself! I thought it was fascinating that Indians stole a 12 year old girl. This biography is based on Mary Jeminson's life while being an Indian captive. Mary misses her family dearly but still carries on. Though she was useless and weak, she was a sister to the Seneca Village, animals, and plants. Many times she tried to run away back to the pale-faces. One time though, she had a choice to stay with the Indians or go back with the pale-faces. Read the book to find out which life she chooses.",1
397,"Still The Boss: Six years ago when I was shopping for a vacuum with a Hepa Filter, the overwhelming favorite among both consumers and consumer protection organizations was the Eureka Boss SmartVac. Today when I was looking for the first replacement part I have ever needed (the attachment hose) I read reviews that indicate it still is! My experience has been consistent with the great reviews that helped me make my decision.PROS: Great suction, the rotary brush can be turned off for use on hardwood floors, and the HEPA filter seems to really work!CON: heavier than most.I am not even considering replacing this vacuum, but I am considering purchasing another to keep upstairs!",1

Could you picture the Pink Floyd Dogs scene (Arthur: ""Do you hear dogs? Johnny: ""Do you?"") without the music? Classic scene.. gone. DVD.. gone. Buy VHS (or watch reruns) if you really want to watch WKRP.. by far one of the best shows of it's time (and still quite funny). Just don't buy this DVD.. it will only encourage them. Stupid record labels don't even grasp the concept that people will hear the song on the show and possibly go out and buy the song (or even the CD). Nooo.. Stupid record labels want to be paid to have their music ADVERTISED. Free advertising isn't good enough.. you have to PAY to advertise our music. What complete and utter idiots.",0

The only other werewolf movie that even comes close to being as great as this is an American Werewolf in London. For a 1981 film the special effects are spectacular! I believe that they are still great, even by today's standards. The best transformation scene I have ever seen. It's a true classic in the horror genre. To anyone who loves werewolves and scary movies, I highly recommend this film!",1
403,Too Small: I am a women's size 7 with normal to narrow feet and these socks are really too small. I have to really stretch them to get them up over my heal and that causes the individual toes to pull back and cramp my toes while the seams dig into the tender spaces in between my toes. I actually can't imagine these socks fitting someone with a size 8 foot. If I were to order again I'd probably get the ones that come up higher on the ankle in the hope that I wouldn't have to stretch them so much.,0

(My brother was doing weird Richard Dawson imitations, etc.) The game works like the TV show. It would be nice to have some buzzers for the competition rounds- but we just had people raise their hand for that part of the game. We added our own sound effects as needed. There are plenty of questions in the game and even the younger kids were wanting in on the silliness. It was a good purchase.",1

My 4 year old watched it a month ago and was excited to see The Smurfs and Pac Man teaching him about being safe. I'd love for this to be put on DVD and revamped for the 21st century.",1

416,"One of Arnold's Best: A down-to-earth, almost realistic action/thriller/drama that has withstood the test of time. Vanessa Williams acts her (beautiful) butt off in this- running from laser guns, fighting atop a cargo container suspended in midair. Add in James Coburn and James Caan, and it is still a great rental all these years later.",1
417,"An Island to Oneself: This is a well written book and has you spell bound throughout the story. I really must call in on this island during my world cruise, sounds facinating.",1
418,Horrible interpretation...: I'm not an avid viewer of the animated version but I saw just enough to get some context. The obvious complaint as most of you have already heard is why the change in the character's race? Usually Hollywood does this to include A-list actors in their films. Puzzling. The script was predictably campy and childish just like the show. I've yet to see a decent movie from M.Night since Six Sense.,0
419,Excellent read: The tone of this book is very conversational and organic. There is a lot of good advice given and plenty to learn from within its pages. It 's not so much a guide to performance as it is a guide to being a performer. You get a lot of insight in to the mindset you would require to survive in the performance industry and some encouragement and technique to boot.,1

421,"Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant Do it Again: Extras is absolutely hilarious... Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant are genuises. This character is much more sympathetic than David Brent, but the cast of characters surrounding him (his friend, agent and other competiting actors) are perfect complements to paint the picture of his quiet desperation. Also, the cameos (Ben Stiller, Kate Winslett, Orlando Bloom, etc.) are great, their characters are so opposite of their public persona that it makes for some really good laughs.",1
422,"A sweet romance.: This was a wonderfully sweet story. Never before has a romance author brought to light the terrible plight girl children of China faced upon their birth. Sometimes I felt Jamie spoiled Ruby and that the girl could have used a little more discepline then she got, which was none at all. But given Jamie's tragic past one can forgive his spoiling the child that could ""literally"" be credited with saving his life. A wonderful story and well worth the read.",1
423,"Porsche 911 3.2 Carrera: As the owner of one of the subject 911 3.2 Carreras, this is the most comprehensive book I've read on this car to date. Some of the descriptions of the car tends to make the author a master of the obvious but generally a good read. Coverage of special models within the range is very good with a fair amount of detail.Given the author lives in England, much of the info deals with cars in that market however, it does have plenty of references to and pictures of U.S. cars. The upside is that living on that side of the pond makes access to some of the people involved with the car and the company (Peter Schutz) possible.Option and color codes are provided as are production numbers broken down by year, body style and market.If you own one of these cars or are thinking about buying one, this is a good choice",1

It didn't work for Audioslave or Metallica.Save your money people & buy music from real artists like Iron Maiden who've been around & know how to actually write good music!,0

I half expected Donnie to do a Rick ""Nature Boy"" Flair figure four leg lock also.Whatever.Donnie showed a lot of passion in the film, but the story line never built it up to present a reason why he was so angry and why he comes across as a rogue cop.It seems like lately, all of Donnie's movies have him as a fighter, but not as a lead character even though he's sold as such.Beyond fighting, he's got a long way before he makes a movie where he convincingly comes across as the lead actor (minus big name supporting cast) where he can carry a film all by himself like Jet Li has done.",0

441,"Van Ronk Re-Make Revisited: This CD contains songs originally released on ""Dave Van Ronk/Folksinger"" and ""Inside Dave Van Ronk,"" both 1962. Van Ronk's guitar-playing, IMO, is excellent. There's no point talking about his voice, because like many blues and folk artists, he has a unique sound; you either love him on a personal basis or you don't, but that's a personal choice. On some of these numbers, Van Ronk laid down his guitar and picked up the (mountain) dulcimer or the autoharp. I like the dulcimer selections--he finger-picks the instrument, and it sounds rather like a banjo. Unfortunately, on the three autoharp numbers, Van Ronk didn't push beyond the very beginning level of playing, so they were rather disappointing. A specialist on that instrument could have gotten much more out of it; I wish my long-time idol had stuck with the guitar or even the dulcimer, on which he displayed a very delightful approach.",1

These new Bond movies are put together without much thought of acting and content plus with each passing movie the special effects become more and more outragious.

446,"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078: I added this movie to the queue, even thou I knew nothing about it, because I love the cast. Summer of Fear is based on the novel, Simon Says, and was a TV movie, and therein lies the problem. This story is amazing and would have made a great feature film, however they had to censor it and dumb it down big time for TV. Corky Nemec and Gregory Harrison were both amazing. I've always enjoyed both of them and together they had fantastic chemistry. Summer of Fear is a very entertaining story that will throw you a few twists. Despite never reading the novel, I'm willing to bet it goes further and is more direct than the movie was.

448,"NO MORE NIRVANA: [...] I will go ahead and say that Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" cd obviously rocks and is one of the greatest rock cd's of all time. The only problem I have with Nirvana is the fact that they didn't age well. Please god, all radio stations stop playing Nirvana!!! When I first listened to Nevermind Kurt Kobain's voice sounded good but now, ten years later it sounds like a dying animal. I'm still a 90's rock fan (Alice in Chains, Candlebox, Stp, Tool) but Nirvana simply did not age like a fine wine like these other bands did. I'm not saying they weren't good but please in the 21st century NO MORE NIRVANA!!! by the way the one star rating was just to get your attention, this cd obviously doesn't deserve anyting less than 5",0

With the shipping to Coby and the $31.00 money order it's not cost effective since I only paid about $62.00 for the TV.

Other advice he gives that all leaders need to heed is ""you always have to work harder than the people you lead"" and ""emphasize the obvious all the time because its the obvious things that beat you if you're not careful."" For football lovers, Bill Parcells' recounting of historical famous football plays and Super Bowls is an added bonus. This is a must read for coaches anywhere.",1

It has such a magical and truthful aire to it that really helped my spirits. I really felt the garden come alive with her superb descriptions; it was as if the garden in my life's snowy backyard were springing into youthful life and hope.

She'll sleep with almost anybody at the drop of a hat. However, there's not a lot of detail in the sex scenes and who cares anyway since Maddie and the reader never get to know anything about any of her partners. There is no buildup, no getting to know any of the men and hoping she will get together with them soon.I read all the Black Lace books, so obviously, I'm not a prude, but I couldn't like Maddie because she was such a slutty woman. I guess the reader is meant to find her near public sex acts daring and titillating. I just found her unsympathetic and got bored by the lack of detail and character development.",0

But other than that this game is awful on some mission no matter how you try to evade enemy missile you are the one ejection from your plane.And the mission breifings are the cheesiest thing I have ever seen. All it is a face in a military uniform with a very bland voiceover. As for the graphics the closer you get to the ground the scenery gets uglier. Whereas on Ace Combat 6 it is very detailed and sharp.

477,X Men in the Year 2099: I got the much sought after first issue of X Men 2099 because I found it for really cheap. The X Men mythos is also adapted into the the now defunct Marvel comics 2099 world that sees classic characters in the year 2099. X Men is like the third best 2099 title behind Spider Man at number one and Doom at number 2. These sees some forgettable characters that don't have the depth and compassion of even Cyclops or Jubilee. Worth checking out for those who got these 2099s when they first came out. Wouldn't recommend this first issue unless you want to make X Men 2099 YOUR comic.,0

497,"NOVA: Secrets of the Samurai Sword: A very interesting documentary on the art and science involved in manufacturing a samurai sword. The journey begins with the selection of the metal and the viewer then follows craftsmen producing a sword using the same techniques as their ancestors. Interwoven are scenes with swordsmen demonstrating their skills on bamboo targets and a brief history of the samurai and historical use of these weapons. Modern science is used to explain the strength of the sword and the reason behind the shape of the blade. My only criticism is making the handles, which can be quite ornate, was not explored. The focus is on the blade.Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in martial arts and weaponry in particular.",1

504,"Psychological Thriller: Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of his generation. That said, the Machinist is a unique psychological thriller in that the protagonist looks like Death warmed over. Bale is so bone-thin, it lends to the fear factor and the realism.The story is about Trevor Resnik, a loner machinist who works the graveyard shift. Strange events begin to occur, and Trevor believes there may be a conspiracy against him. As the viewer is drawn into his world, brief moments of happiness, respite from the fear, do not last long before we are plunged into another waking nightmare. We long for release for Trevor, and it is granted at the end, but not after a bit too long of a rollercoaster ride of mental adrenaline.Recommended, but I recommend the futuristic action film Equilibrium more. Bale is his best here, physically (thank God) and of course in acting ability.",1

522,"Not that orginial, not that impressive: I definitely disagree with the other reviewer that claimed that this album is too heavy for nu-metal fans. I would consider it a nu-metal album, not hardcore or death metal and I don't knock all nu-metal, but this album left something to be desired. At least the vocalist doesn't try to rap (If you're into that check out E-town Concrete or Candiria) and there are some decent, if uninspired, riffs on the album. There is some industrial/electronic influence on the album which I like, but the lyrics to most of the songs are pretty cheesy. The band sounds similar to Chimaira and American Head Charge in music and vocal style.",0

526,"The book is misleading.: I got the first top 5 astral projection books from Amazon, and this is the first book I got, I afraid --this book is 'misleading.'Author thinks, what he believes is astral projection, but what it actually is... combining 'meditation' and 'remote viewing.' Author admitted himself, he is doing meditations. Astral projection is not meditations, author obviously cannot tell the difference, and misled many of his followers. Author cannot see his own astral body, and does not believe in astral body, and does not believe in higher dimensions.Astral projection is a way to exit your soul from your human body, and 'NO'. ..you cannot project while you are standing nor working in the office and project the same time. The book is totally misleading.There are the actual astral projection books out there, awaiting you to explore. Then you will realize how unrealistic this book is.",0
527,"So far so good...: I got this program almost 2 months ago. It works really well on XP and has some good features. I'd previously had a 10 year old version of Works so this is a really big change. The full version of Word is included on this software and it's really helpful for a college student who has to write essays for English and other classes at least a couple of times a month. I'll admit, I probably won't use most of the stuff in this package, but it's nice to know it's there in case I do.",1

The motion detector does not work at all, the laser stayed on for about 24 hrs and then became too weak to even show up on the car. So far Amazon has always provided qualitiy products, but this one broke that record. They should remove cheap quality products like this from their web site.",0

530,"Works as it should: I have a low-budget tube television with only 1 set of A/V inputs, and this device allows me to use DVD, VCR, X-Box, and a PC, all with the one input. It has very low interference, and looks great on each of the 4 inputs. I have a 5.1 receiver with A/V routing, but receivers tend to add a significant amount of fuzz/static. This is common with budget receivers, so I would recommend this as an upgrade from that specific application. This would work EXCELLENT as a video game switcher for older non-HD systems (gamecube, dreamcast, SNES, etc.)",1

534,The Pursuit of Happyness: An excellent film well acted. Father and Son relationship enhanced by the actual relationship of Will Smith and his actual son playing his son in the film.

536,"Street Atlas 2004 is not too good: I got this from Amazon for $49.99 + free shipping - now I see its lower. The Thomas Guide is not available for my area, so the main reason I wanted this was to make an atlas of the area where I live. First problem is that it boots up very very slowly. But the main problem is that it doesnt show names for all streets like regular maps do - and it doesnt show any street numbers like Thomas Guides do. I printed up several maps but I would never use these to replace my regular folding map. But THAT was the main reason I bought this. I havent used it to find an address and I expect that it does that OK. But then there is always Mapquest for that. One consolation is that at least the price was right = I got it free from SBC. (Disclaimer: SBC sent me a $50 credit/debit card and I used it to get this softwhere.)--Doug",0

538,"Lyrical prose. Masterfully told.: The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier, Sea of Grass is definitely a book that deserves a close reading--if only for Richter's poetic prose that makes you want to read out loud.",1
539,"Brushfire fairytales take 2: Another great album from Jack who is showing that he has really found a niche in the market. His laidback acoustic sounds are perfect for a quiet night when you want to kick back and relax. The studio versions of some of his live favourites have been taken down a peg or two in the tempo department and in my opinion could have added an interesting contrast to the ultimately 'slow' feeling to the album especially 'holes to heaven'. For Jack fans, the songs are more of what we want, for those who haven't heard him, this album is sure to place him on the musical map, and for those of you who didn't like the seemingly repetitive songs and slow pace of brushfire fairytales, well just don't listen to this because it's more of the same.The only dissapointment was the relatively short length of the songs mostly around 2:40/3:00 mark.highlights include Horizon Has Been Defeated, Times Like TheseRodeo Clowns, Taylor and gone.",1
540,"Boring: I read a bunch of Heinlein books for a large college report, and I have to say it was one of the most boring reports I've ever had to put together.

I don't know where Em picked up this new type of flow[whiny,nasal pitched singing voice] but it's garbage. Even the singles are wack. Why write Mosh, was White America not good enough. Just Lose It is especially weak, even the video. It seems Em put no thought in this project and it shows in almost every track. What's most shocking is the production. It's horrible. No matter how bad this record is there are a few highlights like when track 20 is finished the agony of listening to this uninspired crap is over. I swear listening to this is the equivelant of chinese water torture.",0

Now we're stepping into J-Lo territory. The video for ""Red Blooded Woman"",like the song, is very mediocre. It seems like the director and choreographer couldn't come up with anything. The Chemical Brothers' remix of ""Slow"" is nicely done. But overall, only Kylie's die-hard fans will find this one enjoyable.",0

554,J.B. Lee: Terk HDTV is a good product because I did buy a second Terk HDTV antenna that more suited what I was looking for. The design of this particular Terk HDTV antenna did not work for me. It stuck out too far and was located in an area in the bedroom that would have caused anyone coming by to knock it over and it was not strong enough to bring in the local air channels. I live several miles away from the local stations in this area and I needed an antenna that could do both -- be put in a minimal space and work to bring in most or all of the air channels.,0

564,"An absolute steal at this price!: You've got to be kidding that this book sells for as little as it does. No doubt the diminutive size of each reproduction figures into the low price, but the quality is first rate throughout. Tim's imaginative renderings (at actual size in the reproduction) are bright and crisp and colorful and energetic and...and..and.... If your house, like mine, is filled with coffee table art books, this bite size morsel is just perfect to fill in the little crack left in a wall of books. Not only do you get spectacular images, Tim has included information in the back about when and where each picture was shown. Each image is placed on a black matte background which launches the image toward you. The binding in the book is first rate and will last well into the future when it becomes that hard to find collectors' item in 3004. And if you're reading this review you know you don't even have to get up and go out the door to get it, so get it!",1
565,Painfully bad: I had to stop reading halfway through because this is so awful and painfully bad.

First of all, psychoanalysis is not a science, which makes these authors' approach to Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum's respective ordeals cheap enough, but even with that, it's an abomination to put two women who were victims of the Holocaust under such horrific, over-analyzed scrutiny. As Richard Nixon once said, ""I don't mind when people put me under a microscope, but when they use a proctoscope, that's going too far."" Indeed! This book is so bad it's unbelievable.",0

574,"Good introduction to 20th Century Theory: This book is an excellent primer for the basics of twelve-tone and atonal theory. The book's biggest strength is its pedagogical approach and clarity of difficult concepts. One can attempt to learn atonal theory through Allen Forte's book (and many did), but much of his book is theoretical, not practical, causing difficulty in distilling the main topics. Fortunately Straus's book has been revised, so I hope the repertoire has been expanded a bit, to move beyond the canon composers (Bartok, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, etc). In short, if you're looking to understand the musical materials behind atonal music, this book is a fine place to start.",1

I called the support line (a toll call -- no 800 line for support, even under warranty!) and was told that it would take 11 days for a replacement printer to arrive! After complaining that my business couldn't function for 11 days without a printer, I was told that I could get the printer in 2 days for an additional $20. And, of course, I have to pay to return the broken printer as well.So, this solid, inexpensive printer is no longer either solid or inexpensive.

If you are entertaining and want to add a bit of style to your appetizers, get this book. I only wish it would have had more pictures. There are only a few photos in the middle, and the vast majority of dishes have no accompanying picture. I like to see ahead of time what the dish should look like. But, don't let that stop you. This is a very good cookbook and is a standard reference in my kitchen.",1
602,"Sound quality okay, must be aware of volume in crowded places: the problems i want to note are that the sound doesn't stay around your ears it eminates out pretty easily. and the sound quality is kinda iffy at times, it sometimes sounds ""fuzzy"" like its hitting its peak or something. whereas any other speakers headphones don't have this. maybe it'll get better with time?",1
603,"This book's main strength is its brevity.: I'm a lifelong Thane fan and love the gentleness of her books and characters. But in this book, the hero and heroine--really, those terms are too strong--were barely in existence. Why would anyone love either of them? What was so special about them? Both seemed passive and cringing, and it was difficult to see why each found the other transcendant. But at least it was short. Thane's strength was in history--even in her magnificent Williamsburg series, the earlier books were better and more vivid than the contemporary volumes. This novel further illustrates that difference. And _what_ is the significance of the title?",0
604,"No effort!: This film had no effort put into it. With so many great players to talk about, it was a particularily dry film. The selection of clips that were supposed to offer insight into the players greatness were often poorly chosen, while little information was uncovered. This movie only has a purpose if you want to know who was actually on the team, but nothing else will be gained from this film. Noteworthy is the absence of Clyde Drexler and Christian Laettner, because this film was made in 1991---before the two were named to the team and a whole year before the team played their first game.",0
605,"Disappointing, even for the money...: I bought this one and all I can say is be very careful, the cannister containing the ice cream is made of VERY thin and flimsey metal. I made a total of two complete batches before it got banged up and dented by just spinning in the ice. A big leak developed and the unit became useless. And Rival is listing replacement metal cannisters at about the cost of three new units....Buyer beware...",0
606,"Does not Work At All!: After reading the review I ordered this items couple of months back, When I cook anything with water in it, it throws water and spoils the whole kitchen!Please do not order this, if you want to avoid the hassle of searching your return box for this Pressure cooker!ThanksDS",0
607,"Good but not great: Sacred Fire: Santana Live in South America is a nice recording of an early 90's Santana concert.The sound quality is first-rate.The musicians, while very good, are no match for the Santana band of the late 60's and early 70's.Of course, Carlos Santana's fiery guitar still has the power to carry the show.I didn't particularly care for a few of songs on this album (like Esperando and Make Someone Happy) but the renditions of their earlier works like ""Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen"" and ""Toussaint L'Overture"" are fantastic.Overall a rewarding musical experience but for the best live recording of a Santana performance I'll stick to ""Lotus"".",1
608,"awful taste: I don't know how they did it, but this stuff tastes awful. Expiration was 2012, I tasted it today - June 2010.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS - YECCHH!",0
609,"Don't let the title fool you.: This Cd is one of the best jazz Cd's Ive bought. Tom Scott's cover of "" Love Will Lead You Back"" is one of the best covers of a song I've heard in a very long time. The highly underated Lisa Fischer gives a spectacular vocal performance of "" Way Past Goodbye"". The entire CD is rated A-1 from beginning to end.",1
610,"one of my most beloved books ever: I met a lady on an airplane and we spoke about books we liked. She said you must read the Glass Castle. I finally read it and could not put it down. The story is amazing, the hardships she went through. It reminded me of a family in our small town in Mississippi. The friendship and love she and her siblings shared was both touching and moving. You will laugh and cry, if you liked this book you will love Saving Georgia.",1
611,"A good compromise: Maybe it's because I'm new to kettlebell training, but I find the Kettlestack sits a bit higher, or it is ""longer"" than a standard kettlebell. When holding it in certain positions, the length of it somewhat affects the balance,or feel of it as opposed to a standard kettlebell, making it less comfortable. Also, the metal strips on the side can beat up your wristbone pretty good. That being said, the versatility of it is worth the compromise. I already had a full set of weight plates at home, so the $60 investment is worth it. Maybe not as good as the ""real thing"", but you'll still get a great workout and save a LOT of money.",1
612,A classic for all Christians!: This book has the time tested truth that only someone that has walked closely with the Lord could know. You will read this book for the rest of your life!,1
613,"Classic?: I don't get it. The book seems to meander and go off on crazy tangents to no purpose. And yet, there must be a lot I am missing. I have read that many famous people have kept a copy of this book with them all their lives. For example, I read that Prez John Adams always had a copy with him. And the Spanish PM always has a copy. I have tried reading it in spanish and it is no better than the English so it couldn't be a translation problem.I would like to see a synopsis of perhaps the subliminal messages I am missing. Something must be there but what?",0
614,"Slow moving, but not bad: At first I thought the book was too slow, dragging out, then it got better, but by then I really didn't care anymore. I think that the author went a little overboard on Redmayne's ""bad"" past.",0
615,"A Great Book!: I got this book for my 4 year old for Christmas. He's a dinosaur nut! He loves this book. The pictures are fantastic and there's a ton of information. Granted, he isn't ready for all the info in this book but it will grow with him and be useful for years to come. (Or until the scientists make new discoveries and all the info changes. ;) ) And to be honest, we got this book as much for us as him since he always asks questions and we were tired of never having the answers. It's a nice reference over all.",1
616,"It's good for small puppies - not big!: When I put my 8 week old golden retriever in it the first time, he climbed out! He put his paws on the side bars and got out and landed head first in his water dish. It also seems pretty dangerous for puppies if they get their paws caught, they could break their legs. As far as the quality - it was pretty good. The rubber pads on the bottom are pretty hard to put on and stay on. It did attach well to the crate that i have. It just seems too flimsy for a larger puppy - again, mine was only 8 weeks old at the time. I do think it is a great price for what you get!",1
617,good stuff: I bought this cd when it came out and i have to say its probably my 2nd favourite VF album..I was surprised to see it wasnt released in usa...It has some great VF songs on it and is definitley worth tracking down to have in your collection...,1
618,"Never received: It is kind of hard for me to tell you how this hard drive performs since I ordered it from J&R Music and Computers back in August and NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! They took my money right away, but after several initial communications, I can not even contact them anymore. Not even sure if they are still in business. I ordered this product while I was deployed to Iraq. J&R says it was shipped, but have not provided any proof of this or provided me with the hard drive I paid them for 5 months ago. NEVER buy anything from J&R MUSIC AND COMPUTERS. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF.",0
619,"Good movie: Not much to say. Good story, Christopher Walken is awesome, great ending, not too much gore.Four more words are required...",1
620,"Didn't work!: I have used this product in the past for ferrets and it worked great. However, it did not even phase my 8 month old Golden retriever. I sprayed/saturated it onto his extendable leash and he still chewed right through it like there was nothing even on it!",0
621,"Truth triumphs: Let me see if I got this straight: all but one of the top reviewers in the U.S. rave about this book; some of the world's top writers (including Clive Cussler and Larry Collins) call it one of the best books of the decade; Warner Books paid 1 million to publish it; Columbia TriStar paid another million to turn it into a movie; it's an international bestseller, published in 12 plus foreign countries and it's up for a number of awards. Now, on the other hand, we've got one obsessive/compulsive reader here who keeps writing in under assumed names and email address (confirmed by URL ECCO locator) who hates this book for personal religious reasons and can't abide the fact that other people like me love it. I think the jury is in on this one. THE LAST DAY is a fabulous novel, brilliantly written and powerful in its message. And that's the TRUTH!",1
622,"Beautiful!: Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. This story will make you laugh out loud and then cry for the characters' heartaches. This beautifully written tale is one that stays with the reader long after the final chapter has been read. I have recommended this book to several friends and they've all loved it. I wanted to crawl into the story and live with August, May and June. I wanted to mother Lily and protect Rosaleen from injustice. This book changed me. I can't wait for Sue Monk Kidd to produce another jewel like The Secret Life of Bees.",1
623,"it manages to be both thought-provoking and fun to read: It's not often that a book can challenge some ideas you hold near and dear while at the same time leaving you in stiches. A friend of mine insisted I read ""Flight Maps""--I'm a confirmed environmentalist/tree-hugger etc., but Price has held up an ideological mirror to me and exposed some of my most treasured assumptions about ""pristine nature"" along with the contradiction of my consumerist lifestyle (yes, I own an SUV--to drive to the mountains!) coupled with my ecological sensibility. Maybe all that humor made it easier to swallow. In any event, I'm glad I read it. One of those books that really changes your perspective on life.",1
624,"Truly amazing work!: I wanted to title this review ""Why everyone with two brain cells to rub together should read this book!"", but I guess that is a little lengthy. It is, however, what I think about CREATURE TECH.CREATURE TECH is a story that is as fun to read as it is difficult to classify. It has elements of science fiction and horror and action and religion and romance (only a little, guys; don't be afraid!) and comedy.... and on and on. And yet, all of these _very_ different elements come together to tell a very engaging and powerful story.Doug TenNapel writing and art work together to fashion a graphic novel that is unlike anything that I have ever read (which is, in itself, enough to recommend it). CREATURE TECH is a seriously thought-provoking, funny, and memorable work of literature.Here's hoping that we see MUCH more from Mr. TenNapel in the future....",1
625,"Not Really Worth It...: This just didn't work. I waited the three days of using no deoderant per the instructions. I tried applying sparingly (it didn't work). I tried applying liberally (still didn't work). The cream has the smell and consistency of diaper rash cream and contains a lot of zinc - so perhaps this is just modified diaper cream! I don't mind sweating (as I did with this product) but I had smelly pits in less than a day. I'm now off to try Herbal Magic Roll-On deoderant, recommended by several friends at work.",0
626,"""No Strings Attached""is a hype cd a must have for NSYNC fans: I won the cd on z96 on sunday and got it monday.the cd is totally awsome BYE BYE BYE is so cool and I love ""This I Promise you"" shows the guys have such beautiful voices and are so talanted. i totally am amzed with the cd NSYNC has got the beat and are so in touch with their music.The cd is so great keep up the good work NSYNC! Stay NSYNC always! *Maria*",1
627,"Who said being a housewife was boring?: This book starts out a tad slow but don't let that turn you away - Adler is setting up a little background on each of the characters that inhabit the apartment building and it's well worth it as the story progresses.Rarely do I find an author able to write from so many different characters' perspectives (5? 6?) and still keep my interest. Jenny, the main character (and housewife of the title) is delightful: at times you want to cuff her (gently) upside the head and other times you feel like jumping up and down to root her on. (Which is, of course, the mark of an engaging character!) Adler does an especially good job of Jenny's gradual transformation and ""coming into her own."" (You gotta wonder how a MAN can put himself in the head of a housewife...) Larry is a piece of work - I enjoyed an intense dislike for him! And I won't spoil the ending, but I will say it was quite satisfying!",1
628,"Riding prior fame to write a steaming pile: I have enjoyed many of Forsyth's prior books, but this one was terrible. The finale is worse than I could have imagined, making me wonder why I wasted time reading the book at all. It's not even really clear what the finale is, except that it's over in a flash. If fact it becomes entirely clear that the author must have envisioned a type of terrorist attack and then scrambled to come up with an explanation how that attact might be thwarted and why his hero was there at the right place and the right time; although there is no explanation why the terrorists themselves actually need the hero (in disguise) on their team at all, except that Bin Laden wants him on the team. Um okay, for what? He add NOTHING to the cadre of criminals leading this attack. C'mon, Forsyth, are you kidding me?",0
629,"Childhood Favourite: I remember chewing this gum when I was much, much younger. Loved the watermelon flavour because I could have Summer all the time, even when there was snow on the ground. Now I have found it and am enjoying my younger days all over again. And man, you can't beat the bubbles you can blow!!!",1
630,"I Expected Much More: This novel was a major disappointment. I finish what I start, but this was painful. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. The premise was very promising, involving people extremely important to the history of the U.S. all together during a not very well known episode of American history. The history was, in fact, interesting, but the characterizations, especially of Lee were downright annoying.I am a fan of the three civil war books, but cannot recommend this one.",0
631,"NudeFor?no plot.: Thank God for Instant streaming Nflix,otherwise I would never rent this even if I was paid,the nudity doesn't make for a plot.The Subtitles don't match the dubbed English Dialogue(Italian Film,no Surprise right?)The movie drags on despite nudity from the start(the distribution co apparently runs the credit with nudity).A waste of time.",0
632,"Disappointing: I bought this to make my umbrella strollers more versatile when traveling by airplane. I even bought it after reading the poor reviews others gave it. They were right. It sounds good in theory, but doesn't deliver in practice. I sent both back immediately. It may work as long as you never want to keep an actual beverage in it. My opinion is don't bother.",0
633,"A thought provoking read, recommended: Almost as tumultuous as the war itself, the postwar was no time for peace. ""America's Second Crusade"" is a reprint of William Henry Chamberlin's critically applauded book from after the end of World War II about the United States, Soviet Russia, and the United Kingdom's plans for peace following the massive world wide conflict. Critical of the concessions made to the soviets, ""America's Second Crusade"" is a window to the politics of the time, and a thought provoking read, recommended.",1
634,"Compact & Durable: I received my first of these flashlights as a gift. After it was stolen out of my truck, I bought two more. It is compact and durable. The xenon light is very bright and the LEDs provide a good close distance flood light. The best features are the compactness and light options. The negative aspects are the special battery requirements and the weight. I still like this flashlight better than the MAGlite.",1
635,"Better than the room spray but not by much: This is supposedly genuine lavender but the fragrance is overwhelmed by the addition of orange peel. It is not as horribly unplesant as the lavender room spray that smells like a rotting orange, but it is not worth buying again. I'll be going back to imported French lavender candles.",0
636,"Don't Like Her Lyrics: Well, I suppose her music is ok but I do not her lyrics. Speaking of which, her voice doesn't sound that great to me.",0
637,Bass?: Very disappointing. After having Bose in-ear phones these seemed to be huge step down. Very tinny and shrill sounding no matter what EQ setting on my iPod. I figured you get what you pay for and I returned them to Amazon. On a whim I bought some Magnavox MHS1100 earbuds at Target for $6.99. Wow! They were way better sounding than the V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds with much better bass! Very happy!,0
638,"Started smoldering: I loved the machine and it worked great until today as I was using it it started smoldering and smoke started coming out so unfortunately I am now without a machine . Unfortunately the return policy is only for a month . I guess I got my use out of it I used it about 6 times , just frustrating to think it was going to work and now without it .",0
639,great entertainment: I was late in getting hooked on this series and so was happy to be able to purchase the season sets. Owning the sets is great because of the bonus features. Very entertaining. I share bits with my freinds that do not have time to watch the whole show. Already done with the first 3 seasons and hoping mother's day brings me more or else I will be ordering them myself.,1
640,"Good quality crib at a great price.: We bought this crib based on the reviews and low cost and it's 4-in-1 feature to use it over a long period of time. It arrived in a large box and was assembled in a short amount of time. I was not too impressed with the clear coat finish on the natural colored wood since it could be easily dented or scratched just with my fingernail. But my wife loves the look and my 1-year old son even enjoys being able to stand and hold onto the railing. We purchased seperately a cloth rail cover to keep his teeth from making marks on the front rail. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and the quality of the product.",1
641,Awesome Lotion!: This stuff is amazing. Not greasy at all. Love the smell and the texture. HIGHLY recommended!,1

643,Waste of paper: Boring storyline. Hated the concept. Unknown why anyone would write such a stupid book.,0
644,"Build me up Buttercup: I love the song Build me up buttercup. However, when I got the CD I thought it was terrible. Nowhere, in the description does it say remixed. I was totally disappointed and from now on will only buy these types of CD's if they guarantee it to be the originals.",0
645,"Drivel: I got suckered in reading the editorial reviews of this book - funny look at a stay at home mom. It was condescending, snobby, and the main character was far too materialistic to really care about at all.",0
646,"Truly Great Book deserves a Great Movie: I just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal.",0
647,Very bad: I bought one of these systems 18 months ago - the first one broke down and AT&T replaced it BUT I had to pay for mailing cost. Now after 12 months the second one has broken down. It will not take messages. The phone works and the answering system is answering but not taking messages. Very disappointing experience. Do not recommend.,0
648,"DANE COOK rocks.: Not since Aunt Bunny's fall down the stairs have I laughed so hard. DANE COOK is the real deal. After years of being witness to way too many unfunny stand-up comics, this is a breath of fresh air (if I could've caught my breath, HARMFUL IF SWALLOWED had me splitting the side from begining to end). Comedy Central has made a smart move by releasing CD/DVD packages of some fantastic up and comming comedians (check out MITCH HEDBURG too, different from COOK, but hysterical nonetheless). A very animated COOK shows his talent in both audio and video segments and his style of stand-up is so confident, it feels less like written material and more like a funny guy just making you laugh. COOK is apt and well versed in entertaining fans of both witty banter and physical humor as well, making him a pro at his game. An extreemly entertaining couple of discs that anounces the footfall of one of the top acts in new American comedy.",1
649,"Another Ozark Classic: With Don't Look Down The Ozarks released another classic album in 1977. This is once again country/pop rock at it's very best.Any album with a song like ""Giving it all to the wind"" on it is a classic. Everytime friends of mine who don't know The Ozarks hear this beautiful Larry Lee song they are completely blown away by it. The rest of the songs are far above standard country rock quality. Why these guys weren't as popular like The Eagles is still one of the great mysteries of the 70's !! There are 3 bonus tracks on this cd version: ""Sweetwood"" is one of them and is one of the best ballads ever to have been released by The Ozarks. Talking about quality control.......this track was never released until now !!So once again.........go out and buy this album !!!PS; Some more good news; The CBS album from 1980 will als be released by the good people of New Era in november 2005 !Greetings to all Ozark fans,Martin from Holland",1
650,"Pretty good DVD Player: BE WARNED - that not all of these players come with the DVI cable. I purchased my through Amazon.com last week and mine did NOT come with a cable. I purchased the $100 Monster Cable.The picture quality of the player is impressive, especially in 720p mode. Quite a bit more information is transferred to the television in that mode than in 420p and there is noticeably more film footage displayed. Overall, the player is probably worth the investment if you have a DVI capable television. Just remember, this player may cost you $229 plus $100 if you are one of the unlucky ones (like myself) that does not receive the cable in the box. Amazon and Samsung really need to rectify that inconsistency considering how expensive that cable is.",1
651,"Well written, but...: This work is very well written, but either the author is determined to present to the reader the image of Lincoln we all got in grade school or he didn't do nearly enough research into Lincoln's reign during the Civil War. For a much more accurate and documented view of what Lincoln was like during the years of the Civil War, I highly recommend the book, ""When in the Course of Human Events"" by Charles Adams. Adams' book will give you everything your grade school teachers didn't tell you. History is written by the victors.",0
652,"Great ball: We got the 2-pack of this product and its been wonderful. Both balls are fully intact, with barely a tooth mark. They're soft enough that he can bite down and squeeze the ball, but hard enough that it stands up to his teeth. Good bounce makes for some fun catches. Much more durable than a tennis ball which my dog can crack and tear apart in a matter of a couple play sessions.",1
653,"No love, no logic here!: There are so many better parenting books out now that there is no need to read this one! Where is the love & logic in hitting a child under the age of 3 over & over until he complies? Where is the logic in letting a dog be gassed at the dog pound instead of feeding it? One part of the child rearing technique is called Basic German Shepherd commands (come, sit, go, no stay). The misguided authors actually seem to believe in this! It's scary! This book only got a rating of 1 because there was no choice of 0. If you need a book about firm discipline & don't want to train your children like dogs (which they most certainly are not), try a much more humane approach, such as in Jane Nelsen's ""Positive Discipline A to Z"" or Jerry Wyckoff's ""Without Shouting or Spanking."" Please don't use this book!",0
654,"Like having your own interview consultant: Ms. Alexander provides a great source of help with her PharmRepSelect book and CDs. I read a couple of books on the subject and found the PharmRepSelect Interview Insight discs to be tremendously helpful. I combined several books in my mission of getting a job in this field. For under a hundred dollars, I feel that I got the best info available. It's like hiring an interview consultant; hours and hours of help. I listened to mock interviews and practiced my techniques. I learned how to phrase my answers more precisely and sound very professional, which was the key in doing well on my interviews. I recommend this unique package to everyone interviewing for a sales job. Five stars!",1

660,"What happened?: I am a big fan of the Q man, but what the heck did I just watch? I like twists, but after watching all 4 hours of the Kill Bill epic I felt like I had been robbed. Volume one was great lots of action, humor and symbolism. Volume 2 (with some execptions) was just empty and predicable. At the end I hated everything and everybody. There was no coolness, no latent hipness. No angst from somebody who was locked in a video store overnight - just a sort of sick contest to be the most unlikeable. There was a possiablity for a really cool ending that would have redemed some and explained more, but instead we just get a stupid joke and emptyness.I expected more.",0

666,"Makes you think.: The documentary certainly looks down on the subjects. The rave guy who acts like he knows so much, actually is so clueless he doesnt know the name of the date rape drug. The research by the members of the church is horrible. The film is gritty (both in subject and lighting) and some scenes had no relevence (dating & football matches?) Watching the film a few things popped into my mind 1) where is the scene with the abortion doctor murderer. 2)I hope none of the people ever get raped or depressed. Arogance at it's best",1

And the other books I have read (""Sex and death to the Age 14"" and ""Morning, Noon and Night"") are just fantastic books. They made me laugh out loud over and over and over again.This one however.. Not quite... It is more a ""transcript"" of his stage performances.

No, it's computerized so it sounds good. So if you saw Hilary outside and you asked her to sing, she would probably sound screechy. Not to mention her lyrics are stupid.

Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm. It does fit in the kitchen sink though. I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub. It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher. She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!",1
690,"Great read!: I had no idea there had been so many UFO sightings, nor so many different varieties of creatures, manimals, etc. This is an intriquing account of the many mysteries and possibilities.

He makes it known several times that 'he is simply listing actualy reports'.

I was really hoping this Clone Wars series was going to make up for the turds Lucas put out with those last three movies, but I was sadly mistaken.

""Avatar, the last airbender"" was a great kids cartoon...the characters in that series were dynamic and fun to watch, you actually care what happens to them.Also, i personally think every writer on this show should be fined $1000 every time they make one of the characters say ""I gotta bad feeling about this!"".

The cover it comes with is a little rough, but I simply bought an inexpensive single bed sheet and two pillow cases, cut the sheet in half lengthwise and sewed a super long pillow case for it.

For some reason many iPod docks lack this obvious feature.Cons:Three of the buttons (shuffle on/off, backlight on/off, repeat on/off) simply do not work. Perhaps this is because I am using it with an older iPod, but that still seems pretty lame.Sound quality is mediocre, provided cables are of poor quality.Dock does not seem to turn the iPod off when powered down.Video out supports photo or movie viewing but does not support a browsing interface while listening to music.Overall, I am not impressed with this product and will be returning it for something that works better.",0

In the end of the movie...At the end of the movie there is a guest appearence by 80s rock star Billy Idol. His music video for White Wedding is in the movie at the beggining, too.

He's sold a zillion records and his quarterly royalty checks are surely still among the biggest in the business even though he hasn't had a hit in 18 years. He packs 'em in at his concerts.

The shaker is spacious, which is key when you're making martinis for four people at once. The striking design is certainly a conversation piece, and I don't know which my friends enjoy more: the drinks themselves or watching me make them. The only drawback I can see is that sometimes the strainer piece will become lodged in the ""bullet tip"" cap. . . cold ice not only shrinks the container, but lowers the pressure between capped strainer and bullet tip, creating troublesome suction. For practicality, the bullet tip should be left off when shaking, but it's not that hard to remedy even if it does happen.Five stars!",1

I feel like I've heard all this before and the movie didn't add much to my knowledge about the difficulties of living in Iraq post war. Of course life is hard there and people are being killed. One scene shows women talking about the Americans shooting outside of the mosque and coming into the women's prayer area. I feel their pain as I watch, but overall I found the movie to be a bit disjointed. You get brief scenes of American military making plans for the election process, scenes of UN election supervisors, and you follow a doctor/candidate throughout his country. There is no narration. The movie just keeps flipping from one scene to another. If a person doesn't know much about the war or war's effects on people, perhaps this is worthwhile. For me, it didn't add to my knowledge of the true face of the war.",0

The problem with it is not in the reissue. Castle has done it's best to make this listenable, and even includes both the mono and stereo versions of the album, which is great. The problem is that the original recording sounds almost like it's a bootleg recorded by someone in the audience. This is good in that it has a kind of raw feel to it that makes it seem like you're actually there, but for the most part, it's hard to listen to. The crowd is frequently louder than the band, and the overall sound is rather flat. I would reccommend this to any Kinks fan simply because it's all that is available of the Kinks performing live in this era of their career, but be warned - it's rough.",1

736,"Nicely arranged compilation: This isn't a complete archive of their works. That would obviously be a boxed set. However, they have chosen a good collection of mixes here, mostly their own (hence indicated in another review that was unfortunately mostly negative). Chris Cox and Barry Harris like everyone else have gone through a subtle change of styles in the way they mix their different singles for artists. Their signature hard anthem sounds paved the way for their current trend towards power synths and hard tribal of today's singles like Thomas Newman's ""Six Feet Under"", which is just amazing (not included in this compilation, unfortunately). I've met both of these guys on separate occasions, just saw Barry again last week. As I am working on my own mixing at this point, it's nice to stay inspired by the talents of guys like this who have made today's sounds what they are -- and forging ahead the sound of dancefloor of the future.

738,Mannix -- 4th Season -- Best One Yet: Actually in the middle of watching this DVD set as I write this. Season 4 is probably the best yet and I look forward to seeing the second half of the series. The transfers are excellent and the show plays as well now as it did 40 years ago. Bravo to Paramount and CBS Distribution. Let's see Season 5 before the year 2011 is out!,1

741,"Great Movie on the Life of a Great Frontier Lawman: Though I am not a big Costner fan I must aknowledge when he does some superior acting,and in this classic,based on the life of one of the greatest lawman of the West,Wyatt Earp, he does just that. Filled with a moving story featuring Wyatt's earliest days in Kansas City, through Dodge City, to Tombstone and beyond it's a long trip but never boring. I must admit that Kurt Russell's action filled ""Tombstone"" I find even more enjoyable to view: but as a gritty realistic view of the Earp brothers attempts at settling down, this is a must see. Excellent cast! Am instant Western classic.",1
742,"I'm Not Surprized...It's a Compaq Right!: I like the features of the unit. The PC compatibility, the ease of the async software and the display. However, like many many others, I am very disappointed with the longevity of the battery life. To put it bluntly, It SUCKS! Maybe 4-6 hours in the standby mode while not in use and at best 1-2 hours when on. It must stay in the charger to be any good at all. Also, with no backup battery to hold data, a long day or trip is out of the question unless you can charge in route. My advise...look at another option to purchase if you need to use this other then on your desk and in the charger cradle.",0

It has sections about animal patterns, matching animals with colors, etc. that are a little over her head.

It's very stylish and looks great, but the way the rack itself attaches to the wall mount is by one tiny little surface screw. The mount is secure in the wall, but the weight of the double towel rack bends the tiny screw its leaning on where it attaches to the wall-mount and falls down. I've even purchased larger surface screws that won't bend and that held it up for the past 6 months, but those are failing now too.Bottom line is that if you get a double rack (which is a worthy convenience) make sure to investigate how the rack attaches to the wall mount and that it is more than what you would use to attach a TP holder.Don't recommend this product, and subsequently the manufacturer.",0

This product features items that are hardly worth the price tag, and according to my CPA, features that will hardly be used by even the most sophisticated accountant. Customer support is horrible. I used Quicken and then Quickbooks for quite some time and was very satisfied. Many of my associates have complained about their difficulties involved in navigating Quickbooks. This has not been a problem for me. I don't have an issue with Intuit and I am not a disgruntled consumer. Quickbooks is a great seller simply because people don't know any better. Unfortunately, the newer versions have higher price tags and are couple with less than optimum customer support. I am now using MYOB, and I will tell you that it's like a breath of fresh air.",0

Because of the on-line capabilty they had to change the handling. Which pardon my French: ... now! It is nowhere close to the great handling in the first game and the championship is only an option if you play it online. All in all I'm very dissapointed with it. Unless you are a hardcore on-line player and can't live without the net capability I would not recommend the game for you!,0

The box makes it look like a really neat toy.Here's the truth:It's terribly made of cheap cardboard pieces (including the tokens)It's pain to put togetherIt will fall apart many times dueing gameplay.It will not fit back into the box assembled, so it will need to be completely taken apart and reassembled for each play.The game is just not fun. Spin a spinner, move the cheap cardboard pieces on a cheap carboard board. Pressing the ""trap"" trigger shakes the whole thing and knocks every piece over, so every turn is spent picking up the pieces again. No originality. You literally may as well get some dice, some pennies, and a piece of notebook paper with some squares drawn on it.

765,"Good Gun Club extension: This is one of Jeffrey Lee Pierce (from Gun Club) Solo-CDs. The most similar to Jeffrey and Gun Club I have from those days, is Iggy Pop. But in style it is not the same, however, both of them vary a lot. So I can't describe its style as good as necessary, and therefore, I would like to recommend: try before you buy. For me, this ""Wildweed"" is a good, solid and consistent effort. A little bit more pop/rock oriented than Gun Club itself. I would describe it ""Gun Clubs Mother Juno light"". This is what I missed from Gun Club, so it perfectly fits in and I regard it as welcome Gun Club Extension. Despite its small shift towards pop/rock orientation, there are still more than enough edges to keep it away from mainstream. Jeffreys great voice and his capturing melodic hooks drive you surely throu this CD. If you like good rock with an edge and insist on having a passionate vocalist with a unique good voice, give this a try.",1

The connectivity is very good with two toslink inputs, one RCA input, and one toslink output. I have my PS3, cable box, and the dvd player hooked up and its very convenient.

800,"Traditional Sermon-Preparation Revisited: Haddon Robinson presents one of the evangelical classics on preaching. The work represents the sum total of the traditional methods of homiletics and does it in a manner that will resonate with many expository preachers. For the most part, the work introduces little new information, but certainly does an excellent job repackaging the material for the modern expositor. Some of the new topics include the concept of a inductive message, which is still quite new for most preachers in conservative circles. Another helpful item in this work is its structure. The structure of the entire book is designed to give the expositor a number of stages to mark the progression from the text to the sermon. As a helpful secondary source, I would also recommend Bryan Chapell'sChrist-Centered Preaching: Redeeming the Expository Sermon.",1

I had only contempt for the PF's because I was not trained or had the personal compassion for the Vietnamese as the Cap regulars had.The book goes into great detail of how extra ordinary a Marine must be living in an outpost with the shadow of death hanging continuously over them. Being responsible for the lives not only of their comrades but the people they are there to protect.So now I know what it takes to be a CAP unit Marine thanks to this wonderfully written book.Semper Fi",1

807,"Simple Solutions for My Chronic Disorganization: I highly recommend this book for people who are chronically ""messy"" homemakers. I have to admit that the book did discuss too much of the ""whys"" of messiness, but if you can get past the first part of the book, you will be surprised that the second half of the book provides just as much of the ""hows"". I have read quite a few de-cluttering and organizational books, which have been very helpful, but this one has helped in a way that none of the others have been able to. I have been struggling with a messy house for the last 13 years, and after 3 months, my home is organized! I've tried lists and time schedules and they just don't work for me. However, the ""flipper"" idea in the book works like a charm! It helped me from getting overwhelmed by distributing small jobs over a period of a month. Cooking and grocery lists are much simpler now also. If you are sick of having a home that you are embarrassed to show your guests, read this book!",1
808,"Good Quality and Convenient: I have tried a few Wireless (RF) Headphones for viewing and listening to TV while my wife is sleeping. I have tried some budget products as well as high-end ones. The Sennheiser RS120 is the only one I have decided to keep. The charging cradle is convenient, the audio quality is quite good, and the setup was quite easy. And, the price isn't that much more than some of the budget items on the market.On other models, the tuning feature could be painful and inconsistent. Each night, I would have to re-tune the headset with the base which was quite annoying. The RS120 was fairly easy and I don't lose the setting from night-to-night.Only thing preventing me from giving it full 5 stars is the noise leaking from the headphones. My wife is quite sensitive so I have to keep the volume low so as not to disturb her. Better sound insulation would make this a 5-star product.",1

810,"Interesting book, not appropriate for executives: While the content in this book is fine and reasonable, I found most of it simplistic and not applicable for people looking for executive jobs. It includes helpful hints like ""you'll need to set up a home office for your job search,"" ""make sure your kids answer the phone in a professional manner,"" and ""don't stop paying your bills--it will mess up your credit."" There are stories of people who changed professions mid-career, with examples being a building contractor who became a doctor; a banker who became a website developer and a woodworker who became a biomedical engineer.Fascinating reading, but what does this have to do with executive job searching? Not much.",0

819,I hope nobody is still reading this book: This book is way out of date by now. Singleton for an example has been a clear antipattern for years now. The rest of them are poorly explained or more complexity than they're worth. Overall the concepts of this book are workarounds for the short comings of strict OOP. Avoid over-complicated inheritance hierarchies and this book is pretty much unnecessary.,0

821,"Clearing misconceptions: This drama goes past the newscasts and explains more in depth how the Laramie community was affected by this tragedy. Rather than portraying a bunch of ""hicks"" who were perceived as not caring by the media when the murder occurred, this book explains how most of the citizens of Laramie were affected. This is great in that it goes beyond the murder and looks into the aftermath and how the town was changed by the life and death of one special young man.",1
822,not ready for market: It seems that this planer was not tested thouroughly before being distributed. The digital scale has to be re-calibrated after being turned off and back on. The locking casters don't lock. The serrated infeed roller leaves marks on softer woods on light passes. The disposable knives are very poor quality and leave valleys in the planed material along the length of the boards. Both sets of knives I tried were completely dull after less than 300 board feet of planing. The flexible blades are self gauging but are difficult to wrestle into place. These results were after checking all factory settings with micrometer.,0

When my eyes get tired I can change the print size to rest them. I love it. I can't find anything wrong with it. If you read as much as I do ( 2 to 3 books a week) this product is for you. I have so many books in storage it makes my family shudder to think about it. I wish the Kindle had been invented years ago. I read many of the reviews and the problems that I read were no problem to me or easily solved. I would rate this a 10 star if there were 10...,1

828,Laughable comments: I see these supposedly scholars on here calling it rubbish and unscientific wherein they purport in believing that drivel about Darwinism as scientific proof. There proof extends to the fact that some fish crawled out of the sea millions of years ago began evoling and stood up as an ape. The ape climbed a tree and one day fell out breaking off it's tail which forced him to stand up. This is the drivel that the so called sudo science of Darwinism would have you believe.

I never grew to care about any of the characters, although the main male character, Michael Travis, was tolerable. The female characters were just obnoxious.The telekenetic aspect was ridiculous and grew tiresome very quickly. The political aspect was just way too much -It got boring and confusing. The characters had absolutely no chemistry together and I had a hard time telling who the main character even was, Melissa or Jessica. The entire book just seriously lacked any sort of substance.I stuck it out until the very end, hoping it would get better, but no such luck. I truly hate giving such a low mark, but this one really deserves it.",0

838,"Christian Fiction?: I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I was extremely disappointed. It just seems that Karen Kingsbury writes trashy fiction for Christians and in my opinion the way this book turned out I don't even see this as Christian fiction at all. It was littered with adultery and in the end we get the sense that the Lord would reward the adultery (I have not read the other books in this series and will never touch another Karen Kingsbury book again). I won't give away the ending. Unfortunately, Ms. Kingsbury tries desperately to write like Francine Rivers and even copies the manner by which she places Scripture but she is far from the gifted writing of Francine Rivers. Francine Rivers actually chooses topics of depth not the trashy romantic novel reinvented in a Christian paperback that I am so sick and tired of....No more Karen Kingsbury for me...",0
839,"Lincoln and Bolivia vs, the shapeshifters: This episode takes us back the the alternate universe and gives us a look at the emotional side of the shapeshifters. In the previous timeline shapeshifters were emotionless automatons who just followed the orders they were given. In the current timeline, these are people who feel the loss of their families and friends and wait for David Lee Jones to come back and heal them and support them in their daily lives. Lincoln looks at his counterpart and tries to decipher what made the difference in their personalities - his counterpart being cooler and bolder than himself. One shapeshifter volunteers to help the Fringe team, but it comes at a high cost. This was a nice twist to show there is still some humanity left in the ones who were abandoned by Jones.",1
840,"Bring back Young Justice!: Young Justice is one of my favorite shows. The voice acting is great, the animation is some of the best I've ever seen, the plots are interesting, and it has a great balance between action and humor.

I was so upset to hear Cartoon Network decided to cancel Young Justice and I hope they will reconsider.Highly recommended.",1

843,"This is the WORST Movie I've ever seen in my life: However, it is hilarious and I love it. It makes absolutely no sense at all and that's why it works.

Are there really parts 1-5 or is this an urban legend?",1

It is marvelous in showing how Adam and Eve were multi-genetic and how all the races could come from just two individuals. It covers other areas of creation (plants, dinosaurs, etc.) but learning about the multi-genetics of our forefathers was the most profound for me. God clearly does not make mistakes and planed all the people in this world to be of all colors from the beginning (just like flowers and animals are). It does not get unnecessarily complicated and mind-boggling -- it is clearly written and very easy to read so children and adults both can understand it.",1

We get about 400"" of snow a year on our mountain so when you get into your car with snow all over your shoes, it can melt off and make a huge mess.

848,"Not useful unless you are already very familiar with VC++: This book is certainly not the book you would want to read if you want to actually learn VC++. It gives good introduction to the wizards and new tools provided by VC++ 6.0. However, the book does not explain anything regarding the approach to programming using MFC or VC++ in general. Most of the book is filled with code that is automatically generated by the wizards, and that too without much explanation. The reader would keep on typing code and keep on running the applications successfully without knowing what is happening or why the code is being written the way it is written. Certainly not a book for beginners.",0
849,"Good, but not as good as Ong-Bak: When I first saw Ong-Bak (that was last week), I thought to myself, ""damn, this movie is amazing!!!"". I told all my friends about it. I was hooked on wanting to watch more of Tony Jaa's movie.Well today, I saw Tom Yum Goong and let me just say that the story was just too dumb. Some of the fighting scenes were too exagerated, like when he put on the elephant bone and started beating up guys twice or three times the size of him. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy most of the fighting scenes, but this is definitely not as good as Ong-Bak. Ong-Bak was more realistic, and yet very entertaining.",1
850,"98% + 5% (Military points) = 103%: The author gives a great knock down on the material and basics of civil service testing for police officer. However, there are several tests out there that ask personality type questions. The book will not be of much help to one in this area. Answer the questions honestly and keep your integrity intact. If you don't pass, hold your chin up and go on to the next test. Chances are that the police department that uses the personality type civil service exam, need flexibility in choosing the right individuals for their department. Yes, the good old boy system is still alive and kicking. Don't feel blue. It is no reflection of one's intelligence or how well you test. Recently, I took a text-book, civil service exam. With the use of this book, I was able to score very high. If you are looking to pass the Police Officer Civil Service Exam, I highly recommend this book.",1

856,"Skip it: Nothing happens. Anita discusses the nature of relationships with Micah. And they have sex. For the entire book.At the very end, she reanimates a corpse, and hilarity ensues.But for the most part, it's just that conversation about feelings that you've been avoiding with your partner. Skip it and move on.(not the conversation, though, that's one of those boring things about relationships that should probably happen in real life, but doesn't make for interesting storytelling)",0
857,"Wish I'd read the reviews first.: Painful said it all. I got to page four and quit - sorely disappointed. I am becoming an addict for the royals, actually biographies in general. And I enjoy a story-telling as much as anyone else. But it was unnecessary to promote gratuitous sex, and more especially to do so at such an early turn. I was looking forward to reading the book after I had read that the writer had spent twelve years researching, etc. Those years and that effort cannot be recovered: the product sadly doesn't reflect the real cost of the author's work.",0
858,"Great!: This is gospel/religious music that has been given a jazz treatment, but a treatment that is very respectful of the music's religious nature. It is beautiful music, it is extremely well played (and sung), and the recorded sound-quality is about as excellent as you will likely ever hear on CD. The only caveat is that, as a live recording, you occasionally hear audience applause. It's a great disc.",1
859,"Book was not up to its title.: Being new to using Macromedia products, I found the manual pretty limited. After reading this book I feel I was better off with the manual. It was not the best 25 I have spent. It is very poorly illustrated, the files referred to in the book do not exist on the CD, not well structured. The author presumes prior knowledge of Flash. I feel some more use of screen shots would have done the book more justice. I personally think this book would be ideal for someone who already knows how to use Flash (then why would you buy this book).",0

Well Dragon Quest VIII is the exact opposite of those games. Everything in this game is perfect... really... They've refined the old-school RPG to create this perfect universe that will keep you hooked for a 100 if not more!!!From game pacing to depth to animation to graphics... it's truly a master piece. Akira Toriyama's character design brings back all my love for Dragon Ball and makes this games an instant crush. The Hero even borrows some character traits from Goku.Overall if you love RPG this is a game to own, no doubt! If you've never been into RPGs then run away from this title. If you were on the borderline of trying one, the learning curve might be steep because you'll be into deep RPG ground but you'll never regret investing your time and money in there!",1

Hally discovers that the color of one's skin is not as important as he previously thought. Even though this is a theme prominent in Fugard's other plays, Fugard still triumphs. It falls short of My Children! My Africa!, yet remains a masterpiece in its own rite.

They will not honor their own warranty unless you buy from one of their ""authorized resellers'. This was buried in the product's manual and not even mentioned on the warranty card that I filled out and returned when this was first purchased. Many emails over a month long period provided no solution. The responses that I received from the ""customer service manager"" demonstrated that they had no concern for my business. I will go so far as to say that they were curt & rude in their responses. At no time could they come up with a reason for not standing behind their product. I refuse to do business with a manufacturer that has such little concern for their customers. Look elsewhere for a quality product that has a reputable manufacturer standing behind their products!",0

If you slow a Supremes song way down, it becomes, whoa man, heavy. If you overly dramatize your voice and throw in a fake vibrato you become, ooh baby, soulful. Spin a Leslie speaker really fast and you're psychedelic.Then again, you might just sound like Vanilla Fudge. Faky voice trills, heavy-handed organ playing, poor arrangements of ordinary songs. Basically, all the excess of sixties-type bands poured into one really boring album.If you want to hear what was great about that musical decade, buy ""Sgt Pepper's"", the Stone's ""Aftermath"", ""Surrealistic Pillow"", even a Steppenwolf album. Hey, buy ""Green Tambourine"" by the Lemon Pipers. But give this one a pass.",0

Edgerton fails to create memorable and true-to-life characters as he usually does; I had trouble keeping names straight in the book, and I never felt as if I knew any of them. ""Where Trouble Sleeps"" is uncharacteristically vulgar and crude for a work by Edgerton. Frequent profanity and allusions to masturbation that have nothing to do with the plot are things one would expect from a mainstream novelist, not from a highly esteemed Southern author like Clyde Edgerton. Has he sold out to the rest of America and kissed the true South goodbye? Only his next novel will tell.",0

The flat head design makes it easy to stir up the bottom of the pan or pot. The wood used is very nice also, and it is a pretty spoon, especially for the price. Only the olive wood is more attactive to me. I would highly recommend this product. It would be a great first wooded utensil if you had to choose just one. Great quality for the price.",1
901,"An absorbing novel about the very begininng of Christianity: This is my all-time favorite novel. The story alone would be riveting, even if it were not based on Bilblical history. I highly recommend this story about Marcellus, a wealthy Roman soldier, who gives up his sword, his money, and nearly his heart to find out more about the man who wore The Robe. It paints a vivid, easy to visualize picture of Rome and the Holy Land just before the death of Christ and the years following, when the news of His resurection was spreading. See why many did not believe in Jesus until one of the men present at His crucifixion vouched that He indeed was dead, while others vouched that He indeed rose again. The story of Marcellus is an easy to read work of fiction, that could have believably occured.",1

This book is full of mistakes, the information within this book is very informative but also very frustrating when you spot all these obvious mistakes, this book was rushed to be put on the shelves that is for sure, it can't of been proof read because if it had there would be no where near as many mistakes as this. Yes this book i'm sure can help get your CCNP:Routing exam out of the way, but I really don't believe people should waste their money on something that clearly has not been throughly proof read.

903,"Loyal adaptation doesn't mix with confusing execution...: Ralph Bakshi's 70s film based on the first and some of the second books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. While the adaptation is very loyal, the animation, particularly the retroscoping, lacks feeling or scope. Some of the scenes seem very hastily put together and many sequences are incredibly confusing, making this film hard to watch. The runtime, a lengthy two hours, stretches this movie out and soon the story drags on and gets very boring. Watching the film, one wishes Bakshi would have been given more money so that a better and possibly brighter look could have been presented. Instead, we get a long-winded and confusing couple of hours with animation that is very subpar.",0

We've never had a problem with the chairs tipping over. Our table is very easy to clean and still looks great, plus it's small enough to be used out on our balcony, which our daughter loves to do. I'd recommend this table set to anyone.",1

908,"CONTINUES TO AMAZE....: EJ Dickey has done it again. WIth each book he continues to draw on fresh material and amaze me. Between Lovers, in my opinion, is simply an excellent book. I went to the library and thought I would read one or two chapters and be done. Not the case. I read the whole book (took me about 4 hours)...and THEN bought it to read again and support him. Dickey has not lost a thing, rather I think he may have gotten BETTER. You think you know what will happen but then something out of the blue is thrown in. This book does not have as much drama as compared to other EJD novels, but it is definitely more provocative and erotic. I'm not going to say what the book is about because you can read the preview for yourself. Other authors need to take notes from this man. My #1 (or 1a and 1b)books from EJD are FNL and Cheaters. Well, Between Lovers may just be 1c and another certified classic from EJ Dickey....J Carter........",1

""There are other ways of learning about the hind feet of a mule, than being kicked by them."" -- Uncle Remus, ""Song of the South""In this ""review,"" I wish to discuss what happened to the real Henry Lucas, on whom this film was based. Several years ago, Texas Governor George Bush (now US President) commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. This was the only death sentence Bush commuted in Texas.It was shown that Henry was actually innocent of the murder he was convicted of. A time card had shown him to be at his job in Florida the day before the murder was committed in Texas. Also, many if not all of his several hundred murder confessions also appeared to be false, and even incredible.It just goes to show how different things can be from what you think you know.",0

And finally, here comes the new novel. But ...I have to agree with the reveiws before me that this one is the least good (I don't want to describe it as the worst) of her works : the story is predictable; nevermind if the story is predictable, but the characters are boring and one-dimensional; I thought there might be more enlightening scenes involving Andrew, the son, but he just played a minor role; the whole plot is just too easy for the characters and not much development. I've to put it down and go to sleep in between the story ('cos I didn't want to fall asleep while reading it : Woodiwiss is my favorite author and I hate doing this to her).Just keep hoping better novels that at least compares to her usual standard would come soon.",0
917,"Compelling: Michel Thomas is as interesting a person as can be imagined. From his survival of Nazi Germany and Vichy France to his creation of an incredible language-teaching method. The sole shortcoming of the book is the author's tendency to diverge on a tangent and explain the history requisite to understanding the story. (Those unfamiliar with WWII history will doubtlessly appreciate this.) The work serves to chronicle one of the most impressive individuals living today. I highly recommend this book, and once you've read it, pick a language and check out ""<German, Italian, French, Spanish> with Michel Thomas!""",1

This debut from PAUL ANDERSON (EVENT HORIZON) is a nifty little film that manages to exite in it's short running time. Gritty and well acted by some up and comming English talent (SEAN PERTWEE is excellent as usual as a tough scumbag), this flick has some slick production for an indie. A movie that looks good, moves with purpose, and draws the viewer into a world of grime and crime is always worth it.",1

How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are cliché, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality.",0

924,"Definitely not a comedy: This movie always shows up under the category of comedy. I have no idea why. I did not laugh more than once in this movie -- it was a drama if I've ever seen one. Maybe that's why I didn't like it. I went in with comedy expectations (b/c that's what we were lead to believe) and got a drama. Frankly, I was bored. This is another example of a critically-acclaimed and award winning movie that had little entertainment value. If anything, I found it depressing and dull.",0

Without a doubt, this applies also to book design. A well-designed cover can make or break a book when it comes to that all-important ""first impression."" I am attracted to covers that catch my eye, rivet my attention, and pull me into the content. The crisp, appealing cover of Longs Peak does exactly that. An additional perk is the topographical map on the back, which adds both interest and contrast. Why is this important? I'm not a climber. But I love the majesty of the peaks and the challenge of their presence. As a non-climber, however, I need to be enticed into opening--and perhaps purchasing--a book that focuses on a sport in which I do not engage. On the other hand, I relish the history and the rugged beauty of Colorado's magnificent peaks.

955,"Are we reviewing the same product?: Buyer beware...the pretty case cover contains a poorly made video. The sound is muffled and tinny and the video quality is just ok. I've even seen the Blu-ray version and the material is the same content and quality. I was expecting something more instructional and educational from a dvd titled Basic Massage Therapy. This was little more than watching someone give a massage, with occaional verbal cues as to what they were doing. Little explanation as to the how and why. You will learn more by getting a massage.",0
956,"Lame...: I'm not sure how anyone can write a positive review of this movie. OK, I take that back. The only good thing going for this movie are some of the visually stunning sequences. I'll save you from an over-elaborate plot description other than a mourning professor builds a time machine and tries to save the woman he loves, instead finding himself 800,000 years in the future where the human species has split into two after the disintegration of the moon - the hunters and the hunted. The movie is poorly and woodenly acted and I'm truly astonished a studio paid money to make this film...",0
957,"Good idea, rather weak execution: Using humor to appeal to guys not controlling their diabetes, is a good idea. These guys might dismiss regular information campaigns. Basing the story on a real person is an effective approach. Rather than telling Steven Furst's story in a traditional manner, this movie uses a series of movie spoofs to drive the point home to our main character.Does this appeal to those who liked ""Animal House"", a movie I haven't seen? I find about half of American comedy to be un-funny, including, sadly, D-4-G. Most of the jokes fall flat, and can't lift this movie from its low production value.The introduction, the Forrest Gump scenes, the stunts, and the outtakes are amusing, but the rest of this movie makes me cringe. How could this ever turn an out-of control diabetic around? I wouldn't show this to anybody.Disclosure: I'm a Babylon 5 fan. My father is an in-control diabetic.",0
958,"Big Let Down!: I have been a big QR fan since the Rage For Order album, but the honest truth is that this album is very disappointing. I have always respected these guys, but the table turns when you wait almost 20 years for a follow up album to Operation Mindcrime, and this is what they stick you with. It is sad to see that the best has already came and gone for this band. Losing their original guitarist has definitely been a negative for them. Geoff Tate will always be one of my favorite singers though....right up there with Steve Perry and Bruce Dickinson. However, I am still amazed at the lack of in depth lyrics and musical writing ability that went into this follow up album. I think it would have been a better idea to hire some hotshots outside of the band to do the music writing! Maybe albums like this one are the reason that there is still no Pink Floyd The Wall II!!??Ray LowryLimitedAccesstheband.com",0

961,"Would be perfect if it would stay up: I bought this product despite the reviews saying it would not stay on for some. I thought they had perhaps not followed directions perfectly, and that it would stick on my wall. I, like others, read the directions twice, followed them to a T, did not put the rest of the pod on for MORE than 24 hours to make sure it was done curing, and it still fell off less than 12 hours later. I do not know if it is a manufacturing defect or if it only works on some tile and not others, but there needs to be an alternate method of hanging it. I am going to try to rig it without destroying it, and if I can't get it to stay put, I am returning it. Very sad because it is adorable and I was looking forward to using it.",0

973,"LOUSY design, not built to last: The external surface, zipper closing, and actual, individual CD pockets in this binder are fine. However, the individual CD pockets have a plastic flap above them that's supposed to flip over and cover the CD which aren't quite sized right -- it is very hard to flip the flap over, and the plastic rumples.Also, the internal structure is poorly designed and the pins that hold it all together are made of plastic, not metal. The first night I got this I began, gently, putting in CDs, and when I had about 80 CDs in the binder, one of the plastic pegs holding the binder pages together cracked. I don't think it could reliably hold 128 CDs, and would not recommend this product to anyone. The older Radio Shack CD binder I picked up years ago is much better.",0

996,I like the other Munchkin better: One of the good things about this brush is that it can stand on its handle. That means you can avoid the bristles from touching the dirty kitchen counter or worse rolling to the floor.It is sturdier than their other bottle brush because there is no foam at the tip that can get detached. But it is the same reason why I prefer the other cheaper Munchkin product. The foam at the end helps to clean the bottom of the bottle much better. This one is all bristlesAlso the handle is almost at the middle which gets in the way when brushing the taller bottles. The handle scratches the mouth of the bottle.,1

The movie has moments that seem reminiscent of Stephen King's work, but there is no storyline to draw events together.

And as a lot of other reviewers have stated, the bass is amazing on these earphones. It's loud and punchy.Unfortunately, man cannot live on bass alone. The mids and the highs lack punch and presence. I listen to a lot of ""bass heavy"" music like techno, hip hop, electro, dubstep, etc. I like a lot of bass. But it shouldn't come at the expense of other frequencies.If you are looking for earphones with solid bass but better response across all frequencies, I would recommend the Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10s over the Super.fi 5 EBs.

Since I was deeply moved by the film I decided to buy the book. I couldn't put it down- it was even stronger that the film. M Saara didn't try to stick to one side of the story: he wrote it from the point of view of those who took part in the Civil War with no regard to the colour of their uniform. He portrays us the battles and the feelings of the soldiers from both camps in an intelligent and beautiful way and style. After his father's death, Jeff Saara decided to continue his work by writing two other books which all together make a wonderful and touching trilogy. The two novels written by Jeff are as good as 'The Killer Angels' and I would like to shake his hand and tell him how breathtaking and deeply human this trilogy is. Good work! Don't miss it!",1

Lots of memories will flood back if you are old enough to recall these products and their accompanying ads.

When this album came out I played it so much (much to the chagrin of my parents) that I needed to replace it in two weeks. Never before or since has there been such a monster first album. Art? Not on your life but powerful. You bet. Way ahead of it's time. Recently someone gave me a copy of this & the 2nd album on CD and much to my surprise they still hold up. Played it for my son and it blew him away. It's too bad that half way through their 3rd album they made an abrupt about face and changed to a sort of country rock band whose albums weren't bad, just ordinary. The strangest live memory that I have of Blue Cheer was at a concert where they shared the bill with Tony Benett and Sergio Mendez & Brazil 66. Oh MY!",1

This generation of gaming consoles is pretty tricky, but the wii is the most shallow and stripped down of them all. Once the magic of Wii Sports wears off, its pretty much over because there isn't anything you can really immerse yourself in.

It has effectively treated me, and I would recommend this herbal formula, provided it's quality is assured, to anyone with appropriate symptoms. However, 45 dollars is an absurd price to pay for a bottle. The recommended dosage is 24 pills a day, which leaves you with a little over a week for a bottle. If you take this product for a month, you'll spend almost 200 dollars. That said, I've been spending between one and two dollars a bottle here in China, and I've seen it fairly marked in the US for between 5 and 10 $/bottle. But this is what they call highway robbery.

Nightbird, After the Glitter and Whenever I Call You Friend have been replaced by some God-awful tracks, Desert Angel, Loves a Hard Game to Play, and Sometimes its a bitch. Plus, Whole Lotta Trouble does not belong on this album at all and could have easily been replaced with the song Enchanted, Kind of Woman, Outside the Rain, Sleeping Angel or the Wild Heart.When playing a greatest hits album, one should not have to skip past songs. They should all be good. UGGGG!!!!!!!",1

1072,"The Night Is Always Darkest Right Before the Dawn: Dylan has been written off time and time again by critics and fans alike. But every time, he rises to the challenge to confound his critics and delight his fans. This album is a triumph of the first order.Never has Dylan sounded so world weary, or so wise. The lyrics are so honest, so humble, almost confessional. The music is eerily beautiful, in the best tradition of the blues. And Dylan's delivery proves that the medium is the message. The delicate phrasing and tonal shading only adds to the artistry. No one but Bob can sing with such poignancy and quiet power.Keep on keeping on, Bob!!",1

You could say it is a rock album but not really. The sultry sound of Res voice is macthed only by her pretty smile.

Bollywood lovers can easily identify the basic elements: song and dance, necessary love obstacle and a few other nuances. But the film ruined the parody by explaining them with subtitles like ""DEVDAS: tragic Bollywood Hero"". Bollywood lovers have seen Devdas and don't need explanations, and it seems to confuse non-Bollywood fans. It also tried to take a jab at wholesome Bollywood by centering the story around a rich guy who falls in love with a fabulous girl who is really a prosititute. To an Indian, that's dodgy material. Non-Bollywood fans would think, ""They're just copying Pretty Woman."" So you've lost both audiences.I understand Deepa Mehta's intent behind this film, but it misfired. She should stick to those profound dramas she's known for making.",0

The remote had a food stain on it as well as a dent in the middle. The face of the stereo was scratched. By the way, the third one didn't work either. Absolutely do not buy this device.

I don't know what it is, maybe my kids are more impressed by questions coming out of an ""authoritative"" book instead of daddy snatching ideas out of thin air, but they love it.It really does get my kids' minds going and many times I learn new things about them. Parents who are concerned about inappropriate questions only have to skip those questions.

In 1968 this album went to number 4 on the charts--it is pretty consistently good, with ""My Mirage"" and ""Are You Happy"" being other stellar songs.

I have this in front of my EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM which is paired to a 7d. I'm a newbie DSLR guy and I'm really not sure what difference this makes in images; then again I am hard pressed to notice any difference when the IS on the lens itself is on or off. In short, don't make the decision to buy this filter (or not buy it) based on my review alone.",0
1106,"Re:TREESITTERS: This is a book that starts out strong, but gets tired as it goes along. It's an intriguing story of how the autrhor lasted for two years under difficult conditions living high in a tree. The storms that rocked her platform, the helicopter that flew two close were too big challenges. Then the phone calls and the radio interviews as everyone came to know her name. Getting to know the tree and herself as the time continued to pass. As the long negotiations wore on, she seems to tire. Two years is a very long time to spend in such a limited space. Her world was more vertical than horizontal. Still a very good read and inspiring story. Thanks to Julia for living the story and then writing it down.",1

1108,"THIS ALBUM IS HORRIBLE!!: I first heard of Metallica in high school when they were an unknown garage band. I fell in love with their original sound and have been a dedicated fan since then. I was excited to hear they had a new album out I couldn't wait to hear it. To my shock and horror this was the worst album I have ever heard! It doesn't even sound like Metallica! What happened? Personally I think they chickened out of being unique and are trying to be like someone they are not.I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were you, trust me it's not worth it.",0
1109,"Outstanding trance w/ goa feel: The CD is a nice mix of club/techno beats on some tracks, and trance-ambient moods on others. While the artist records in Japan, these tracks have Indian-South Asian influences. Devadesi and Drupak have a real club/trip sound - heavy on the percussion. Chandan and The 2nd gate of dreams are more trance-ambient. My favorite tracks, the title track and Shanti Shanti, are somewhere in between. It's a spectacular blending of techno/trance ambience. The title track (at a whopping 16:20) takes you on a journey that starts in an electronic trance, hypnotizing you with a woman's beautiful voice, the drums subtly make their entrance a few minutes in ... eventually you'll get back to the trance you began in. Shanti Shanti similarly takes you on a wild ride. Easily my favorite Makyo CD.",1

1120,"All For Nothing.: Janet Jackson is an AMAZING woman who has struggled with herself and her image since she was a little girl. Breaking away from her The Jackson 5 and Michael's shadow in the mid 80s, she made everyone recognize her as an artist and a musician. Rhythm Nation and The Velvet Rope were such amazing and powerful albums, while All For You was simply stupid. Janet is 36 now, and for some reason, the album sounds like it should be sung by a 26 year old, or even younger. The tile track is annoying, and most of the other tracks are just kind of thrown together and the final result is All for Nothing. The album lacks a lot of aritistic merit that The Velvet Rope had. Son of a Gun is a bad take off on the incredible Got 'til it's Gone. Carli Simon was famous in the 70s. Th 70s are long over Janet. Hopefully you'll lose Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on your next album and go for a more electronica sound. Buy this album only if you need it to complete your Janet Jackson collection.",0

Though it helped to pass the time on a trip, the story wasn't very plausible, the characters were generally not very likable or smart and, in the end, I wasn't really rooting for anyone except the fact that I was finally finished. This is in no way harsh criticism of the author; the writing was more than adequate, it was the story I wasn't too fond of. I think this just isn't my genre. My mom is way into the movies shown on the ""Lifetime"" network; with a cheating husband, dying wife and bratty, rebelious teenage daughter this story seems tailor-made for the ""channel for women"".",0

I also would not be able to tell you this is a protein powder shake because 1 scoop in a blender bottle has 0 chalky texture. There is no chalky flavor just sugar milk. I am going to increase the amount of milk per 1 scoop because it has that same sugar effect as Yoo-Hoo cholcate milk. Its a bit sweet but not chalky. I will continue to use this product.,1

There are a number of reviews here that sum up the story so I will not go down that road again. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book. Maybe I just have a mental block with him.",0

1137,"Mixed opinion: What can I say. The game was nearly the worst PC game I have ever played. It was a ""Port"" game and the controls were keymapped to ""Awkward"" right out of the box. Game play was simplistic and most of the humor was forced.I beat the game in about 4 hours. Not a lot of content.Now while I was playing there was always the hint of what the game could have been. Maybe somebody up the product chain had a vision that got molested before it got to retail, dunno. There were a few moments that had potential. The UFO thing was funny and totally well set-up before it attacked. Brief as it was, that was a good moment. Some of the animations are worth looking at if you like BBW.So even for $5.99 the game really isn't worth the money unless you just like to burn through cheap, bad games in your spare time.",0

( Sorry, but I won't give the funny parts away. )The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game, if you touch the water you will die!!Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's, try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly. Then you can decide which one is better!!",1

I really expected her story to shine and I really expected that Sam wouldn't be easily forgiven; forgiveness came with no effort on his part at all. The chemistry between the two characters was weak and relied upon their history as children instead of their present personalities. This was by far the weakest of the three in this series and I'm definitely going to be more cautious when buying Roberts' books -- they used to be on my automatic purchase list, but now they're not. This is certainly not a book that warrants above 3 stars. Save your money and borrow a friends' copy!",0

The luggage handlers were not at all gentle on it and I had fears that it would not make it to the end of the trip.

One week into having it I can say that it is by far the best coffee maker we've ever owned. It is easy to fill with water (not messy at all!) and the brew timer ensures you never drink a nasty cup of old coffee by accident. It is sleek, easy to program, with a small footprint on our counter-top - a HUGE deal when you live in New York City! The permanent filter makes our coffee taste better and not having to buy paper filters is nice on our wallets and nice for the planet - WIN!! Highly recommended.",1
1181,"Drivel: Thoroughly dissapointing. Alschuler starts out with hard science and ends with debunking driven by inductive logic. It became painful to finish and left me with a sense of loss, of my time and money. He even has the audacity to question the integrity of Dr. John Mack and Bud Hopkins. Both of which have dedicated thier lives to the subject while maintaining open minds and objectivity. Alschuler clearly has done neither. He fortifies the argument that our scientific community isn't well along toward better understanding of the nature of the universe but that our scientific community is but a mear toenail removed from the dark ages.Amazon.com's Rob Lightner says that Alschuler tackles the issue of UFOs without dammaging his credibility. How could anyone that relies upon this many assumptions rooted in rudimentary paradigms have credibility?",0
1182,"not a very good game: Alright heres the story....I was looking for a good wrestling game for my dreamcast and I found Royal Rumble, it looked pretty good so I ordered it, when I got it there is only Royal Rumble-not very fun, Exhibition- ok, and a versus mode which is probably the funnest mode in the whole game. When I started to play royal rumble every superstar ganged up on me and they only tried to get me out. On exhibition when I would try to hit them they would spin around me and from there on I had no control over them and I could not get 1 hit off on them.And it is almost impossible to get your partner to help you. Also when you go to pin them you end up running across the ring. If you're looking for a fun game to just mess around with then this might be a good game for you, but if you want a championship winning, hard hitting action type game you will probably want to go for WWE Wrestlemania x8 on GC, or Smackdown: Shut your mouth on PS2.",0

So the hardware is OK, but the Mac HP sofware is giving the printer bad instructions.Scanning: Scanning at resolutions above 300dpi results in a ""stair step"" effect, as if the data stream got out of sync. Several calls to HP finally resulted in the suggestion to set the ""Dust and Scratch Removal"" scanning setting to ""Medium"".

The only thing is that when there is too much action on the screen the graphics get a little choppy. But if you go to options, you can change your view to first person. This way the graphics seem to run smoother. There are not many codes for the game though. And when I tried them they didn't seem to work. But over all, I would give this game 5 stars!",1

1205,"I consider this an essential work: In all of my 12 years in ministry and my own journey for Wholeness in Christ, very few people have been able to simplify and illuminate the process of healing from what I hate to call ""common"" or ""typical"" sexual brokenness in our culture as Signa and Conlee. It is a dangerous time now for believers because we can grow so quickly numb to the bombardment of sexual distortions in our society. Even the other day I noticed Disney cartoons making sexual references that I wonder many believing parents would overlook or even laugh at. This book helped me and others to further our understanding for just how subtle evil is, yet how much God desires to heal and what that healing looks like. Please consider this book. If you are struggling with, have dealt with or are being tempted in any areas of pornography or living with someone who is, this book could seriously change your life. God bless. Comments welcome...

I appreciate that you can get to know the main characters and come back to them again and again. But I also appreciate that each novel can stand on its own. Peter Robinson is my favorite kind of writer. He incorporates environment and dialogue brilliantly. I read my very first Inspector Banks novel just before returning to Yorkshire on holiday after an absence of 35 years. I had the joy of living in North Yorkshire in the 70's and I wanted to read something set there to rekindle my memory of details, customs, accent and language. For an American Anglophile, these novels give me just what I need. I escape to a place I love with a story that never stops. Thank you, Peter Robinson.",1

1211,"Information architecture babble: For a book on Information architecture to be useful it can either present new ideas or it can present old ideas in a systematic manner.I am sorry to say, but this book does not neither. No new information is presented and no attempt is made to systematize the knowledge. The book is best characterized as a monologue, with lots of repetitions and banalities, and no adequate final summary.It is, perhaps, of some value for the complete novice on web design, to show that web design can be dealt with rationally, but then again, the chances that novice designers have to deal with large websites is extremely low.There is therefore no reason to buy this book.I give it two stars because it is well written and not incoherent.

I sprayed a black widow in a crack for about 10 seconds straight and it just sat there. I waited several minutes, and the black widow just walked out of the crack like nothing happened.

Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period. No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct ""stab"" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed!

As is, it's pretty much a one act play, with a few scenes of filler thrown in to round it out.Halfway through the book I realized it wasn't going to be getting any better, but I toughed it out until the end. Not much excitement, and pretty one-dimensional plot. Do yourself a favor and just read ""The Firm"" again....",0

Regardless, I would just look at these as just one more possible future (there have been dozens of variant-stories anyway - e.g. Age of Apocalypse.) One of the best things about X-MEN has always been the political and ethical conflict of Human/Mutant relations, and Joss has followed suit and weaved together a story that feels as though it really could be taking place right now.IN SUMMARY: Great story, great artwork, great buy.",1

I've got a fair bit of Becks music over the years, as well as most other notable guitarists like SRV, Tommy Bolin, Gary Moore, Steve Morse, Steve Howe, Robin Trower, Roberet Fripp etc. I think this CD and Who Else shows that Jeff Beck is still wanting to keep updating his techniques & styles after his more commercial successes of Blow by Blow, Wired, There & Back. This newer style is grungy, thick, techno or whatever but top notch as usual and I think proves that some of these older guys can show the younger, flashier jerks that they still have a long way to go to be mentioned in the same sentence as the legends.

So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin.

It throws terribly hot unpopped kernals out of the chute .I have small kids and one of the kernals burned me so I would not have them anywhere near this. The popcorn is absolutely tasteless. We used Redenbacher corn . I'd much rather have popcorn less often and have some that is much better tasting than this. If you do use this, have a very deep bowl to put underneath the chute. A large baking bowl will not do it. It also will not melt cool/cold butter..it has to be soft to begin with. This was not a fun thing to do or use, especially with kids. I'd never let them use this. It may be healthier popcorn when it is popped with hot air, but other than that........",0

The battery lasts forever and the dial shows time, day of the week, and date, all without pushing any buttons. It's indifferent to rough treatment and is, in the strictest sense, a working man's watch. There is no chronograph with which to time yacht races, no alarms to go off when you don't want them to, and absolutely nothing that has to do with skin diving, which is a blessing right there. The only difficulty is that with time the band deteriorates: if I ever find the opportunity and gain the skill, I shall figure out how to make a copper/leather/somethingelse band for this timepiece, and it'll last forever.",1

His writing is brilliant, the topics are hard-hitting and well-researched, and he comes from a thoroughly objective base. It's not scattershot criticism. When I started to browse these reviews, I was startled to find that he has become a ""whipping boy"" for some scarey, out of control lefttists. It's clear to me that he touches too close to the bone, and that makes the Clinton-camp defenders very nervous. I invite those of you reading to keep an open mind to these ideas.

Unfortunately, it was sent by Amazon in a small ziplock bag that was inside a larger ziplock bag containing the charger. The bluetooth headset, which was completely unprotected, must have continually ""banged"" against the charger during shipping. By the time I got it, the headset was scratched and looked used...like something I had found on the sidewalk. Also, when I shook the headset, something inside rattled. I returned the headset to Amazon for a refund and then bought the same model from a local discount store for 20% more.This was the first time that I have had to return anything to Amazon...too bad that Amazon did not ""bubble wrap"" the headset itself to protect it during shipping.",0

However,this film is like some of the other movies trying to enlighten the public on the aftermath of war with little impact. America has a short memory; right now everyone is in ""Support The Troops"" mode. Just wait , once the conflict ends, let's see if the country has the same feelings about our brave young men and women who will need care and understanding.

In fact, constant references are made to the page numbers of a non-existing book. There is a minimal amount of interaction.

His biases detract from the story he is telling about a specific case which deserves public scrutney.

Despite what the other reviewers say on this page, in my humble opinion, the Main Titles (Track 1) is really why you would buy this CD, because it is an inspiring and glorious resurrection of the original Williams Superman theme. The rest of the soundtrack is ""incidental music"" which doesn't mean much outside the film. However, the price of the CD (even if just for 1 track) is justified because of the ""enhanced content"", which if you pop into a Mac or PC, is a short DVD showing, among the usual other throwaway rubbish, an extremely well-edited and well-made ""making of"" featurette of the entire live taping session of the main theme, attended by Bryan Singer and Brandon Routh.

Truthfully we can't really grasp to what Bill went through and mostly we will not be able to fully understand it. Only believe that it did happen. Is it fact or fiction? You decide.,1

1324,"Great Music + Rip Roaring Comedy: Didn't know what to expect out of this DVD I borrowed from a friend but I thought I had just seen the most overlooked movie of 1998. The script was very, very well written and the acting performances were very earnest. The music got to me and I am aching to get a copy of the soundtrack just to hear Jimmy Nail wail ""The Flame Still Burns"" (ending song). The comedy also worked in a lot of ways, specially now that I begin to wonder whatever happened to all those one hit wonder groups from when I was growing up. Interesting must-see for rock fans who loved late 70's, early 80's music scene...it has a fascinating in depth view of ""what might"" have happened to your fave groups.",1

1326,"Christmastime Between the Vines Vo. 2 by Jamie Mills-Price: This book is great for those decorative painters out there the projects are all very detailed so perhaps not for the beginners. This book includes 8 beautifully colored pages and 19 projects with full instructions. Almost every page (70 pages in all) has some design you can use, some of which are not part of the projects. I enjoy Jamie's work, even though the designs are very detailed, these little details really make a difference on the finished product. I have had many complements on my work and the detail involved. Using these designs will make you work really stand out.I highly recommend.JP",1

This set includes a stereo recording of Beethoven's ""Emperor"" Concerto stylishly conducted by Jonel Perlea. Novaes was famous for her performances and 2 recordings of the 4th Concerto. It is good to have her thoughts on the ""Emperor"" but would be idle to suggest this is among the very finest recordings of the work. However, coupled with Mozart Concerti and Sonatas, the issue is irresistable. Her Mozart was in a class by itself. Indispensable!",1

With carefully reading this book I was able to recite all 50 states and in order. This book links words and thoughts of images that all relate to each other. I recommend this book if you would like to learn of different techniques to help improve memory. This just needs to be practiced often so it can become long term use.,1

1337,"Blood Stream - obvious ""Movie"" material: Reading this book was like putting a very unique jigsaw puzzle together. But Beware! In the first few chapters the author cleverly gives you several key pieces to scrutinize, dissect and commit to memory . . . before he takes you down a treacherous trail of unbearable suspense, vicious murder and undying love that stretches from Baja to Key West and across the ""Blood Stream"" to Cuba. Mr. Ferneding very masterfully addicts you to his puzzle, then makes you frantically scour your memory for the missing pieces that fill in the black voids. In the end . . . I still had doubts about the pieces being a perfect fit. My second reading was awesome, as I discovered subtle clues I'd missed! What a tantalizing experience! A definite read for the intellects . . . you'll never guess the ending!",1

Knobs tighened the harness OK for awhile but I always struggled with the levers to loosen it. Now after a year and only two major adjustments, the harness cannot be loosened or tightened.Also, the straps are always twisting (but I've always had that problem with Evenflo)-minor issue compared to the harness adjustment problem. For that reason I would not recommend this carseat or any other with similar knob and lever mechanisms on the sides.",0

Since I am 45, I'm not following any musical trends, but I hope this direction away from violent offensive and crudeness continues. When I first heard the singer, I thought of Astrid Gilberto from the Bossa Nova era. But since Antonio Carlos Jobim isn't writing the songs, they are a little less sophisticated. Nevertheless, Gentle Waves is a nice breeze that has come my way. Ironically, my father just died from old age and cancer.

That student is in an accident and ends up in a wheel chair but still wants the role. Usual weird if not bizarre not too likable school personal, parents who drink and behave crudely and teens looking for drugs, drinking and partying. A cheap take on Glee except that the acting wouldn't pass a high school drama course and the singing was even worse. Predictably he gets the role and everybody does a screeching song and conga line dance to close the performance.",0

It's fun sometimes to hear a performer at a concert jump into an inspired cover. This is neither inspired, nor at a concert. It's a whole CD of, ""well I need some money and I am too lazy to even add something to a cover song, let alone actually come up with something new."" Bad enough it's all covers, his performance is lifeless, lethargic, and apathetic. Certainly, if I wanted to hear any of these songs, I would reach for the original first. This collection is unnecessary.",0

It just didn't happen. At times I felt like the author had forgotten what she wrote in previous books. This book seems totaly out of sequence.

The set was purchased because of the Farberware name and I am now very disappointed.

Rest assured, though, should anyone ask me, I will not be able to recommend this product to them.",0
1354,"A comprehensive and test-based approach that is essential: This book differs from many trading books geared to retail trading. It is comprehensive and its test-based approach puts many trading strategies under a proper review. It analyzes how different strategy performances can be compared and how risks can be put under control. It is filled with many interesting ideas. As it is to be expected, there is no gold strategy that one can use immediately as it is. The reader must think and cook its own strategies. But most, if not all, ingredients and the methodology are given.An updated version covering the current markets and the state-of-the-art tools now available for strategy testing is much in need. New chapters could also cover the latest version of Tradestation's EasyLanguage (used in the text) and what has been learned from trading strategy performance testing in the past decade.But it would be wrong to say that this book is outdated. It is still very valuable. Highly recommended.",1

Stress on the family and children has become the normal. Pam's Connection Parenting Approach and book helps reawaken our inner knowing of how to be with children from a loving place that meets their innate core need of CONNECTION.As an educator, researcher, and practitioner supporting families and babies from the beginning of life, I find her principles and ways of being with children are beautiful principles to guide the way we welcome and support babies too.

The video and sound quality is average and the selection of songs is uneven. She lip-syncs to Nelson Riddle's fine arrangements while fiddling with props on a sterile, cartoonish set that looks like a children's show. In many sequences, she is pregnant and hiding behind windows and giant bows. Also released as ""Rosemary Clooney Singing at Her Best.""

1357,"Sony ICF-C218 Mediocre Product: I purchased this product based on Sony's alleged reputation for good design and quality performance. Unfortunately, it falls short in both respects. First, the buttons are confusing, and too small for a sleepy person to locate quickly when waking from a sound sleep. Second, the sound quality and FM reception are surprisingly poor in this urban environment (where I use it) with strong, nearby stations. Careful locating of the AC cord helps somewhat, but not enough. A Timex T256 would be a good alternative. I'll donate this clock radio to the next rummage sale.",0
1358,"Murder Mystery or Harlequin Romance?: I haven't had to suffer through a bad book in a long time but I just did. Riptide is lame, with all the un-substance of a Danielle Steele novel. Too many unrealistic plot twists, farfetched scenarios, pat explanations and cutesy one-dimensional characters. And since when does every character in a book, from CIA honchos to serial killers to sweet intelligent beautiful victims need to exclaim ""Damnation!"" every few pages or so? I think this book wants to be a murder mystery when it grows up but just comes off as a thinly disguised Harlequin romance bodice thumper.",0

But it just died - won't turn on after only a year or less of use only two or three times a week!! NOT good for Krups reputation.

I've read some ofAyn Rand's writings and am familiar with her philosophy but I've not read one of her novels.After wading through 1,000 pages I have to say I'm amazed that this novel is so popular and enduring. OK, I get it that Rand is a materialist, but she's sucked all the life out of this novel by making it such a relentless polemic. Quite ironically it occurred to me while reading ""Atlas"" that it has all the esthetic appeal of socialist realist art from the Soviet era.There's NO nuance or subtlety here. The characters lack the complex motivations and emotions of real life. The individualist heroes are flat prototypes and all other characters are weak, conformists totally lacking character and virtue.I just can't take this tome seriously as philosophy or literature.",0

1373,"Not for me: Inferno is the first part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy (before Purgatorio and Paradiso).In this book, we follow Dante as he visits Hell, walking down its nine consecutive Circles accompanied by the poet Virgil, and meeting old acquaintances on the way.This should not become a habit, but I intend to stop after the first volume and not finish the trilogy. First, I realize I'm simply not sensitive to poetry. Then, there are too many references to public or mythical figures of the Antiquity and 13th-century Florence, and I'm not sufficiently educated in History and Biblical Lore to enjoy this book.Still, Sisson's modern English translation is good and reads easily. The notes at the end of the book are well-done and help understand what Dante is referring to, but I was too lazy to constantly check back and forth.

I wore the watch every time and everywhere, even when i was having a bath or when i was playing basketball, but still i found it stopped at 3 o'clock one morning, and 5 another morning, and 7 another morning.

We thought it was our cable service - until we turned on a TV in the other room. The periods of time that the sound would cut off got increasingly longer in duration until - eventually - we had no sound at all. We contacted Polaroid. They wanted us to ship it back to them (paying for the shipping) PLUS send them $155.

NOT WITH THIS BOOK. He sits there and looks in awe at the pictures while listening attentively to the story. I think the illustrations are very capitivating and better than that of most books (especially for a young kid). I just ordered two more of his books and can't wait to get them. I wanted to make sure I wrote a review because what I appreciate the most is the renewed bonding I have with my son through reading him something that he thoroughly enjoys. All of the ratings are spot on for this one!",1
1394,"horrible horrible horrible - not worth a single star: Mr. Cohen does a huge disservice to homosexuals. His book will do nothing but harm people; people who are suffering because of the bigotry they encounter in their lives. The American Psychological Association recognizes that homosexuals are not sick or in need of healing. In fact, according to the APA, trying to 'heal' homosexuality is detrimental to a person's mental well-being.If the contents of this book weren't enough, Mr. Cohen further proves his anti-gay bias by associating with the likes of Laura Schlessinger, who has been lambasted time and again for the lies and misinformation she spreads about gays.This is a pathetic piece of literature; a total waste of paper. Needless to say, I would not recommend this book to anyone.",0

Well, the wait is now over and I couldn't be more disappointed. Let's start with the show: It's a Celine concert but the problem is that the stage is so large she looks like an ant. Dragone (Cirque du Soleil) directed the show but it is in no way Cirque like which it was promoted to be. The best songs that Celine sings during the show are not even hers. She does great renditions of Etta James, Peggy Lee, and Sinatra.... The CD starts of great with ""I drove all night"" but it is down hill from there. Dare I say that Celine sounds more like Britney Spears than vintage Celine.",0

I am aware of the '94 remixes by CCN which stayed faithful to the song's original styling while adding some new drums and percussion.I like all of the remixes this song has received thus far, none of which I have heard have rendered this song unrecognizable. Here, the Dimitri and the Bassic Remxies add a few different elements but the original instruments are still on board. NOTE: Track one is NOT the original mix by Francios Kevorkian. It is actually the Paul Hardcastle remix which came out in about 1986.

The exercises are not described per body parts, instead you have to figure out that some ab work is in the ""floor barre"" section, etc. This DVD layout is just a mess. Also, I don't feel that you do enough reps to really work out your muscles. The pictures on the cover and inside are stunning, and I thoughroughly enjoyed the interviews/bios of the 4 models. This DVD is best for glimpsing the life of ballet dancers and getting a rough idea of the exercises they do every day.

It's certainly possible, ""Fat Girls"" comes to mind. This movie I really wanted to like -- the two leads are especially handsome, if a little wooden in their deliver. at least they had some chemistry and you like watching them when they're onscreen. The father figure was pretty bad -- his line delivery was completely unrealistic and embarrassing. Same way with most of the other cast. The dialogue was unrealistic and inane. I think the director has some good ideas -- he just needs to fully develop them before placing them on celluloid (or a hard drive).",0

Boyfriend, L.O.V.E and Burning Up are my favorite tracks.I'm sick of hearing about how Ashlee is a ""fake"" and can't sing. Sure, she lip-synched, but so do a lot of other artists. I don't think that being very vocally talented is a requirement for producing good music. Her music has awesome beats, catchy lyrics and is really appealing. Maybe it is the fact that she is such a normal person - not particular good looking, makes mistakes and doesn't have the body of her sister that makes us commoners really relate to her. I don't care if she is a fake or what-not... her music is really upbeat and great to play at any time.Ashlee - keep on making your music! I'm not embarrassed to admit I'm an Ashlee Simpson fan!

The back window doesn't meet the tailgate so water runs in, but it is a jeep. Can be improved with a little add on piece of canvas sown to the bottom of the window and it will be no big deal. Windows are not stitched, just heat seamed but doesn't look bad at all. Says tinted glass but mine came clear. I'd recommend it for the price. Just don't expect something you're not paying for. Like all canvas it takes some patience to fit properly but it looks good once you get it all adjusted. I'm going to stitch the windows and add to the back and I have no doubt it will give me years of service and look as good as the more expensive tops.",1

I can honestly say I will never watch this movie again, unless forced to. (And yes, I even told that to my professor!) This movie was such a disappointment after about the first 45 minutes or so, especially when it got to the hell part. I even had to quit watching at that particular part because of boredom. I was also disappointed because of Robin Williams' character giving up HEAVEN to be with his SUICIDAL wife. Now how lame is that??? Yes, the scenery was nice to watch, but the plot was, and I am being nice, HORRIBLE. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend NOT watching this, unless you want to watch a horrible movie. Sorry Robin Williams, you had better luck with Mrs. Doubtfire.",0

It always brings a laugh from me - I can't help it.All the pieces are on the border between found sounds and improvised spontaneity, between pop and advant-garde, and between story telling and avoidance of story telling. It reminds me more of Steve Reich's pieces (where he brings forward the natural melodies and rhythms of speech) than of any other composer.",1
1446,"very disappointed: Plate temperature is far to hot so it's impossible to cook anything without charring the outside crispy. Cord is too short. Non stick surface is false advertisement as far as I'm concerned as everything stuck to the top plate with the tenacity of a good superglue. The design is good in theory because the top plate doesn't have to touch the food, but even though it's too hot for direct contact, it's not hot enough for cooking when locked into the bracket for broiling. Furthermore, because of the hinge design, when you can manage to clean stuck food off of the top surface, it falls down through an opening between the two plates onto your countertop. I've used Foreman grills for years and was willing to put up with the inadequacies of the cheaper models based on the low price, but even buying this one on sale I paid too much. Unfortunately I will soon be adding it to the local landfill.",0

They've been MIA for 7 years and Scott Stapp looks like he's in great shape but he was a little rusty sometimes and wish he just surprise us and didn't introduce all the songs. I didn't think that was necessary. He will get better once he gets his groove later in the tour. The rest of the band performance was just superb. They've included a new touring guitarist former Submersed Eric Friedman. He gives the band a more dynamic sound especially on ""A Thousand Faces"".

I was hooked, as soon as one episode ended, I wanted to watch the next one. 2 1/2 hours later I realized I had finished the first disc... The performances of John C. McGinley and Neil Flynn steal the show. The cast, in general, is great, and the writing is spectacular. By far, this is my favorite show on the air right now.",1
1463,"Great product, but don't let it get wet!: Overall, I love the Intel. But I am on my third one. They first shorted out from me sweating on it while running. The second shorted when I got caught in a rain shower. If you plan on using it outside while running, just make sure it does not get wet. Love the neckphones, once I finally got used to them.

1465,"Definitely Daringly Delightful: A great read. A bullet from start to finish. It's not for everybody, as reviews are indicating, sort of need a sardonic sense of humor to get it. Thomas Harris comparisons are not relevant, however -- he's nothing like Harris. The obvious influence here is Jim Thompson's classic ""The Killer Inside Me"" -- also a first-person story of a serial killer cop who delights in putting on a deceptive front. Lindsay apes Thompson's style down to the use of ""Well."" as a paragraph. This isn't to criticize. Thompson is a great influence to have.One cavet: The first chapter is inexplicably horribly written. It's like something from a different book, some parody of a serial killer novel. Plow through and you'll be rewarded.",1
1466,"A good follow-on book: This book is a solid follow-on title to Ms. Truman's bookFeelings Buried Alive Never Die.

1467,"Also good for your morning orange juice: My ordinary juice tumblers are wearing out, so I'm trying alternatives for a new set. So far, I'm very happy with these. They have all the qualities of the inexpensive Riedel line, including being able to go in the dishwasher. And sure 'nuff, I can tell a difference between a glass of riesling, even *cheap* riesling, by drinking it out of this glass. (My major experiment was using a bottle of wine that was merely okay. The glass made it a *better* okay. I think it still ended up in a fondue.)The glasses are just a tiny bit fragile for everyday use, but I'm comparing them to heavy juice clunkers rather than a wine glass. They do make my morning juice look cool. If you're thinking of them for wine service, though, they don't seem quite as elegant as stemware... on the other hand, it'll be a lot harder to knock one of these over.",1

They are soft, fit perfect, look cute, and work fantastic. My kid cried when I took them off him because he likes to wear them. I read other reviews so was careful of the cable and had no problems with them breaking (although my kid chewed on them periodically). They are still working great and you cannot beat the price. If they break I will replace them with the same thing. Get them to keep you and your kid sane on a long plane ride.",1

But after bashing her mother, Vivi, in a New York Times interview, Sidda is plagued by her mother's distrust & hurt, retreating to a Washington vacation home.Sidda is sent her mother's journal, the Divine Secrets. Sidda learns of the lives of the ""Ya-Yas"" before the weights of marriage and children.

The second part of this book(search by the Foundation) follows Arcadia, preffered to be called Arkady, as she travels and finds out where the Socond Foundation is (or so she thinks). Her father is also working on the subject. Just a few words( they won't really spoil you the ending) DON'T READ THE LAST PAGE UNTIL YOU REALLY GET TO IT! I did and it spoiled me all the fun, especially the last two words, if ya know what I mean.Read it from begining to end. Also(you'll know when you read it) don't trust Anthor! I will not tell why, you'll have to read it by yourself.

This is the perfect companion to my Nikon D40 for casual photographs for a casual traveller. Nearby subjects or faraway mountains, birds etc I don't need to change the lens. Have been using it for now more than 3 years without any issues.The only minor annoyance is that sometimes the lens and camera will take a few seconds to adjust. I have to press the click button 2-3 times on very rare occasions for a photograph to be taken. During this time there will be some camera noise since the motor will be moving trying to adjust.",1

And in this day and age, putting out an ""Exclusive 2-Disc Special Edition"" with no deleted scenes is highway robbery and flim flam.

I had purchased the original in 1984, but this blows that away!: If you are a fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan, casual, or seasoned, I STRONGLY recommend this version of Couldn't Stand The Weather. The bonus material alone is REMARKABLE and BREATHTAKING! As I have said before, I had met Stevie in Dallas in 1982 and saw him play live in 1983 just after Texas Flood was released and as a guitar player, I was amazed! I was a HUGE Hendrix fan and had never heard anyone play like him. His studio releases are great, but if you really want to hear Stevie at his peak, then listen to him live. You can really see into his soul. I have purchased two of these CD's as I have done with all of his releases. I keep one to listen to and one for my collection. I know that there are many people that think that what could be new from an album that was released in 1984, but you would be amazed to hear! The unreleased stuff is great as well!",1

He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls.

All of the tracks are much slower, focusing more on the opera part, as opposed to the techno/pop. i would still give this cd a splendid 4 out of 5 stars, but i would just like to get across the point that it doesn't have the type of songs that are advertised. thanks.",1

Quite awhile later, I discovered CHRIS RYANS's book ""The One That Got Away"". I rushed to buy Chris Ryan's book, since I was now hooked on true tales of the S.A.S., about the Gulf War, and of the British Army in general. I was impressed by Chris Ryan's side the story - it was fascinating, honest, and matter-of-fact. HOWEVER, Chris Ryan does not have the story-telling talent and the quick wit of Andy McNab. I found Andy McNab to be a talented writer with an amazing ability to recall the past with astounding clarity and detail.

Dr. Heriot has a unique ability to not only paint a broad landscape with bold brush strokes to cover the history of civilization but also to focus, and keep, our attention on the finer details of human invention leading to human accomplishment. He also offers his own 12 'real lessons' of history ""not in the flow of political and military events, but in how we think"".

It was NOT delivered in the original packing box (as pictured above). Yes, it was bubble wrapped for shipment, butit did NOT make it work (any better).3.

What about the kids who get good grades, have supportive parents, read very well and 'don't feel good about themselves'? What about 8 and 9 year olds who suffer from sleepless nights and stress because of standardized test issues? This is typical narrow-minded, right-wing bellyaching that is about as objective as MSNBC and the Fox News Network. The current wave of accountability testing is already collapsing under the weight of its own disjointed logic.

Much of the dramatic appeal comes from the fact that the friends and family surrounding them seem oblivious to the pain each is suffering. This BBC production is only an hour and a half long, which obviously means it has to leave some details from the book out (and actually changes a couple of points).I own three different versions of Persuasion and I love this one because of the passion shown between the two characters, but it is the one farthest from the actual classic novel by Jane Austen.

I have previously owned another espresso maker that I ended up trashing cause the pump just quit after 6 months. The Breville Cafe Roma has never given me any kind of problems, even after my once and sometimes twice a day use.

I got used to that inconvenience and have enjoyed delicious latte and espressos from this machine for the last 5 years.",1

1547,"Sensational storytelling . . . and from a 21 year old ???!!!: If for no other reason than the obvious difference of opinion about this book . . . it should be a ""must read"". It certainly can't help but intrigue. Why the confusion ? Why the ratings from 1 - 5 stars ? What's going on here ?Well, for me, it is simple . . . the confusion rests in the fact that the book is so well written with such good insight into life's vaguaries and the way little events affect people's lives that it's almost impossible to understand how a ""kid"" of 21 could have put it together. The story alone is worth the time, but the insight is just fabulous ! Forget the synical, over intellectualtized reviews that appear before this one. THIS IS THE REAL THING !

You have ZERO leverage to pop the clip loose and must use significant brute force. The two rubber ""feet"" at each end quickly went M.I.A. resulting in metal on glass contact. The plastic molded around the grip broke into three strips (sides and top) and fell off, leaving the squared corners to dig into my hand as I tried to ""jiggle"" it.

I've never played it or seen any screen shots, but it will be awesome so I am giving it five stars based on nothing other than gta3."" You realize that it affects the overall customer review average, and if the game comes out and isn't that great, the review average will be higher than what it should be because of people writing reviews way too early. Wait until the game comes out and you've played it to give your opinion on it. It makes no sense in wasting people's time and possibly money by doing this. I myself believe this game will be great and i will buy it as soon as it comes out, but i am not going to give it a 5 star rating just because i think that...what's the point?",0

I have been checking the site everyday and for over a year the price only dropped to $7.49 two times! It's cheaper to buy the diapers at the stores with coupons.

Of course, being a good Mennonite who doesn't go to the movies, Magdelena and the rest of town is thrilled. When the movie's obnoxious assistant director is found murdered (with a pitchfork pinning him to Magdelena's barn wall), Magdalena suddenly finds herself as suspect ""numero uno"" in the murder. So Magdelena puts her detecting skills to work to find the real murderer, with hilarious consequences.I found the characters in this book endearing and very funny. Magdelena's Mennonit point of view puts a funny spin on many things the rest of us take for granted. I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to the Amish country, and I look forward to reading more installments in Ms. Myers PennDutch mysteries.",1

1564,"John Barleycorn by Jack London: If you want to know about Jack London, this is the book to read! He talks about many events and adventures in life with his not so nice buddy, John Barleycorn(whisky). The book can be a lot of fun as he talks about his adventures when he was young and yet it's very sad in other areas regarding the loss of many of his friends due to alcoholism. And the book is disturbing how his thinking becomes haunted and depressed as he becomes a serious drinker when he is older. He tries very hard throughout the book to fight John Barleycorn and his strength, honesty and sincerity is an inspiration. I couldn't help but compare this book to Craig Fergeson's American on Purpose book. It's extremely amazing to find these guys rise out of the clutches of John Barleycorn.",1

Needless to say I was not disappointed when I got it. The footage is awesome of this super talented band that Dweezil has put together to keep the music of Frank Zappa alive. I strongly recommend that anyone who claims to be a Zappa fan add this to their collection. Dweezil has done it right in honoring his father's music.,1
1567,"A Bookend Account--best at start and finish: Middlekauf's book starts off with a far more detailed account of the roots of the American Revolution than are offered by most books; I especially enjoyed the explanation of the Townsend Acts and Pitt's strange withdrawal from running the government. The middle part of the book was a bit unsatisfying and disjointed; he never, for example discusses Benedict Arnold's treason, and the surrender at Yorktown seemed almost anticlimatic. And those looking for a revisionist or even slightly ironic description of the main characters of the tale are going to be disappointed. Middlekauf gets back on form with the tale of how the Constitution came into being; he seems most comfortable dealing with drawing-room politics. All in all, not bad, but not the classic that others of the series have become.",1

1569,"Not bad: I had a negative reaction in mind the first time I heard this album as I was expecting some warm, soulful gospel like the Staples Singers. I was a little taken aback by the style of this as I don't like a lot of 80's music much at all and also don't generally like this kind of thing either. Anyway, it's weird, but I gave this another try and it grows on you. Mavis is such a wonderful singer and the songs seem greater than the sum of their parts. I think it's actually really good music, though I lack understanding and familiarity with the style.",1

The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter, my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control.

It has been extremely reliable and has saved my Nuvi from a host of potential screen-scratches (the Nuvi fell off of the dash and fell between the seats of the car, wedged between two metal pieces -- NO SCRATCH). I highly recommend this item, but be prepared to throw a fit or two when applying it to the screen!To reply to other reviews, it doesn't get rid of glare altogether, but it certainly helps reduce it. I have no functional problems with my Nuvi -- it is extremely sensitive even with this protective cover on.",1
1579,"Taking Control of your time and life and career!: This is one of the few self-improvement books I would recommend. I own a real estate business and find myself constantly interrupted and incapable of completing one days worth of ""To do"" lists. This book is teaching me how to really prioritize, take time off each day to think (yes, one of the most undervalued assets in the business world today to advance one's career, is to make the time to think) and strategize for better ways to live and work. It also challenges me on how to asess which meetings are advancers of career and which are void of any such prospects.

I sent it off to Tissot and the total repair Charge was $439.18. I can just about buy a new one for this price, so I declined the service. I would not buy this watch. It is a fun play toy....but not very durable. So I now have a worthless piece of metal that I will probably just throw in the trash.",0
1581,"Only one flaw: On the whole this was a fantastic read, the moral dilemmas raised are explored in a thought provoking and sensitive manner from several points of views. The narrative is light enough to to keep the story flowing but strong enough to present emotions that are heart wrenching at times. The fact that the book really makes the reader question their own thoughts and beliefs made this a deeply engaging read. The ending does not provide a resolution but i prefer it that way so for me there is only one flaw and it is the romance that takes place between two of the main characters; in my opinion it was stereotypical, unnecessary and at times annoyingly caused distraction from the powerful central theme. As long as you can get past the corny romance this is an extremely worthy read.",1
1582,"Midler's Best Effort In a Long, Long Time: I received two gift copies of this album - one I would never have bought. I would have missed something good.

As depicted in this movie, men fought for there own reasons but when it came to dying most gave by committing the ultimate sacrifice, for love of their fellow soldiers. Boy's From Company C had shown historicism, not a story. If you want to know why Viet Nam Vets are shy heros or why the Viet Nam war is not taught in history classes in school watch this movie, it will scare the heck out of you, or at the very least, remind you respect those vets.

1586,"Best Bread Machine I have ever owned: I bought this breadmaker about two to three years ago after going through three previous machines. I love this machine. I use it all the time and have never had a bad loaf yet. The only down side is that you have to scrape the flour out of the corners of the pan with a spatula during the first mixing cycle, but this is a worthy inconvenience. You get fabulous bread every time. Bought one for my daughter a year ago and she loves it. Never had a problem with hers or mine. Bought another one for my other daughter, and she loves her also. Everyone compliments them on their bread, and being newly married that's really important. Especially when it's their mother-in-laws making the compliment.",1

It is no wonder Del got dropped from Elektra while working on this album and I should have known better when I picked up ""Both Sides of the Brain.""The thing is, I KNOW DEL CAN DO BETTER. ""No Need For Alarm"" was an amasing album and a classic, but this was plain garbage. He is an amazing emcee, but the mehhh beats can only go so far. Sorry folks, but this gets a thumbs down.

It's nothing but cliches with some very good actors that should have protested having this bad a script. Oh, if you are wondering, the worst movie of all time is ""You light up my Life."" If you saw that, this isn't quite that bad. I found myself sitting there saying ""they're not going to..."" and they always did. Seriously embarassing with some terrific music and terrific actors. Blame the script and the Director. Oh, and someone explain to me how Loren Mazel taught this kid to direct. The kid did a great job faking the guitar he couldn't play, but the conducting was beyond terrible. Walk outside and stare at a brick wall. It will be more enjoyable than August Rush!",0

It is easy to clean, even though it doesn't have a ""non-stick"" coating, and the lack of such coating is why it has lasted this long.In reviewing my Amazon orders so I could review this, I see that I've owned most of my hard-anodized Calphalon for ten years. At the same time, I purchased a whole set of T-Fal cookware, which didn't perform as well and also didn't last--all those pieces are gone--evidence that buying quality cookware is a no-brainer.My one caveat is that you must figure out where you're going to keep it and where you're going to clean it before purchasing.

1595,"Very Poor Study Guide: First of all, I really get a kick out of the so-called experienced Administrators and their comments. Any of you have had at most a little over 2 years experience with these products, which hardly allows you to be condescending to your peers! It's foolish to chastise others for their approach to furthering their marketability. In fact, I applaud those who are trying to find information sources to help them get certified. It is very difficult to have a job diverse enough to get exposed to every product. That being said, this book is by far the worst of any study guide I have used. After reading, I was no better prepared or had a deeper understanding of IIS than before. The Sybex and New Riders books are better when it comes to the MCSE electives.

1597,"Aimless at times.: Though I really like the actors that were in this film, I am quite surprised that the Producers and Directors didn't take better control of it. Some critical points were terribly underdone and others way overdone. It's like there was nobody in charge on the set that had any sort of barometer. Sorry guys. Film was disjointed and sorry again, but lovely Mr. Bloom underwhelmed me this time. Either his heart was not in this film or he was simply not directed at all well. Would really like to see him dig much deeper inside himself. Whatever the case, it was a great idea for a film, but execution of it just flopped.",0

1599,Very disappointing: My son and I read the book together not too long ago. I was so excited to watch the movie and what a disappointment! Some of the scenes were actually laughable. It seems as though Disney threw this together and was unwilling to spend any money on production (coon hunts were filmed during the daytime!) The acting was horrible. With such a wonderful story to work with I am amazed at how bad this movie was.,0

It is not heavy enough with just water in the base to stay in place, but that just makes me move around it as it shifts. I use a 6x8 foam mat area and it is perfect for full side kicks and punching. Make sure you get that cap on really well after the pad goes over it, since this is able to be knocked over, although only by an adult really trying to hit it with 80% + strength. Also recommend you get some gloves for it as well if you will be doing a lot of hitting. The fabric is quite durable, but also abrasive on the bare knuckles.",1

1606,"Interesting Historical Accounts of Interactions between Europeans and Native Americans.: This book contains many accounts of interactions between Native American tribes and Europeans. The accounts are all based on narratives written from the first arrival of Europeans until approximately The French and Indian War. It clarifies that Europeans and natives interacted in a vareity of ways and at different times were friendly or unfriendly towards each other. The French and English also brought their conflicts into the mix as the natives may have brought their conflicts too. A main concern is religion for the Europeans - The French want Catholic Indians and the English protestant ones. Alcohol was a drug easily promoted for trading purposes. When natives became hooked, the price went up. Captives with the natives were often viewed with suspicion and many English chose to live with the natives or with the French after awhile.

1609,"The queen rocks on!: I am a long time Stevie Nicks fan, and love all of her music. This album is no exception, but is one of the most overlooked albums of her career. I love it, from the great cover photo, all the way to the last track on the CD, it's all great. The ""Alice In Wonderland"" theme of the album instantly pulls you right in from the first track, the magical classic 'Rooms On Fire'(my fav song on the album). The other 2 singles to be released were 'Whole Lotta Trouble' and 'Two Kinds Of Love' which is her duet with the great pianist Bruce Hornsby, and also features a great soprano-sax solo by Kenny G. A few more of my favs are 'Ghosts', 'Cry Wolf', 'Long Way To Go' and 'Doing The Best That I Can'. Stevie is in top form on this album, her hauntingly sexy , husky voice just leaves me captivated every time I listen. Brilliant musicianship and arrangements galore, make this a great buy for anyone. If you don't have it, I highly recommend it. ROCK ON!",1
1610,"Excellent Collection!: Any fan of Cutey Honey should go for this collection while it's out there! This gem of a CD features songs from the old Cutie Honey series, the mid-90s New Cutey Honey OVAs, the 2004 live-action movie and the more recent Cutey Honey Flash series. With a grand total of 20 tracks, you're getting a lot of music on this collection. True, several of the tracks are different variations of Honey's familiar theme song, but the rest of the tracks are completely different. Both of the les 5-4-3-2-1 songs from the OVA series are present here along with the catchy ""Burning Up!"" tune played in episode 3. This is a very worthy addition to any Cutey Honey fan's library.",1
1611,"Perfect for gear: I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof, animal proof, and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space. This was perfect!It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time. I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise, its a small, durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?",1

I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM AND WITHIN THE FIRST TEN DAYS, THE FIRST ONE FAILED IN THE SAME FASHION AS DESCRIBED IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS.IT DEVELOPED LARGE HOLES AT EITHER END RESULTING IN HUGE QUANTITIES OF WATER THAT WASHED AWAY THE SOIL. I HOOKED UP THE SECOND ONE WITH THE SAME RESULT IN TWO WEEKS. IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT MY WATER PRESSURE IS A TIMID 40 LBS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS KIND OF FAILURE. THE LIFETIME GUARANTEE IS EQUALLY AS BAD. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO CUT OFF THE ENDS OF THE HOSE AND SEND IT TO THEM AND THEY WILL SEND YOU A NEW ONE. IT WILL COST ME NEARLY THE VALUE OF THE HOSE TO SEND THE ENDS BACK TO THEM AND AND THEN ALL I HAVE IS ANOTHER HOSE THAT WILL FAIL.SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND AGGRAVATION AND TAKE A PASS ON THESE HOSES.",0

Only a few questions pertained to information covered in the book.The art portion was totally useless.

You don't have to worry about damaging it (at least you don't lose an expensive camera) and you can put it in your pocket. I've actually had better pictures with a ""one time"" than with my $500 Nikon. Image that! Kodak or Fuji ... should be about the same. Fuji is usually a little cheaper. Both seem to be just as good. Great to put on tables at wedding receptions!",1

If you have a short memory this is the book for you. She not only tells you how to do something at least 3 different ways, she tells you why and it's purpose. If you are stumped or just missing bits and pieces of information....... this is the book for you. Too bad you can only rate it 5 stars, it deserves far more.",1

1622,THE BLANKWELL (The Inkwell is name of movie): This dvd was a Xmas gift for my granddaughter because her mother was in the band that performed in the movie. There was absolutely nothing on the dvd and we both were very disappointed. I sent a complaint via email and thus far I've heard nothing back. This event will certainly cause me to think twice before ordering any other dvds. I tried to not give this review any stars at all but that was not allowed.,0
1623,"Buyer beware: Worked great for about a year of very limited use. Visit the manufacturer's website forum for issues with this product. Previously purchased models failed on or about the same date. Something about the 2.4Ghz transceivers messing up. I cannot confirm the date because I was inbetween gamming rigs at the time, but I tried to use this joystick after getting my new rig fired up and was set back when I encountered the calibration issues. There is no fix for this and if you hadn't put in the warranty card, then your out your investment. Go with wired untill the manufacturer takes some responsibility.",0
1624,"GOOD ALL AROUND SAW: this saw proves powerful enough and is designed well, making any adjustment simple.I did have to make a slight adjustment to the bevel pointer, but that was a cinch. I do however wish it had a better line guide for 45 90 degree cuts and was a little lighter.All tools have good and bad points. This one is a well made quality tool.Shop around and compare features and you'll see. dewalt is in the big league's.I recommend this tool, quality and affordability is a great combination. Now get out and saw something.",1
1625,"Well Researched and Well Worth the Read: Its like a dog/human version of ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"". The book cites a lot of research into the behavior of canids and primates and helps to bridge the differences in thinking. There are practicals throughout the book, although it isn't a step by step training guide. I have to agree with another reviewer who indicated that it is a bit too politically correct. The author teaches against physical punishment. Admittedly, I'm not a professional dog trainer, but its hard for me to imagine training a rambunctious young dog without an occasional, non-abusive slap on the rear. Overall, a very interesting and informative book which made a positive difference for me and my dog.",1
1626,condition: i was very diappointed with the condition of this product. the cardboard (the whole things is made of cheap cardboard) was peeling in a lot of places. so bad that some of the writing on the backs of the dvds were completely gone. also one of the insides of the dvd cases was broken to where the dvd could not click into it. i was surprised that amazon would sell such a product. i think i should get part of my money back. i say part and not all because the dvds themself were fine and i liked the show.,0
1627,Awesome book: River is home great read and angel city was cool because I grew up in south Fl. and I saw labor camps everywhere down.,1
1628,"Accurate representation: This certainly is an accurate capturing of Amy Winehouse in concert. She's a bit tipsy, her between songs banter with the crowd is all at once funny, charming and rambling. She seems to lose her train of thought a time or two, but when she sings, there is no denying the magic and power of her voice. Her wonderful backing band does a stellar job throughout and the home turf of London makes for a very appreciative and supportive crowd.I thouroughly enjoyed the hour long documentary ""I Told You I Was Trouble."" Some great behind the scenes footage of her younger days, never before seen performances--even a very early showcase inside her record company's offices. If you are a fan of Miss Amy, you will greatly enjoy this DVD. Well worth the price!",1

1631,"Utter Disappointment: I was waiting in anticipation for this movie to come out and was one of the first in the world to see it. But sadly within 10 minutes into the film I was horribly saddened to see that Lucas has turned this film into a childrens movie. Something that should be seen on Disney. Horrible characters, just plain horrible. Ruined the film completely. Jar-Jar Binks was the worst. Just to hear the name sends me into a state of depression. I sure hope for his next film he rethinks how he is going to display his characters.There was no sence of deepness to this film. A five year old child could tell me what everything meant and what the end result would be. Bad. Bad. Bad. I would have rated this film zero stars but I must admit the effects were rather nice. So one star it is.",0

1633,"Perfectly awful: I have been a big fan of this series, but this book reads like a high school student trying to write a term paper due the next day. The backbiting and soap opera behavior of the characters and the plodding plots make this book extrememly tedious. The only enjoyable parts of the book were the ones dealing with the technical aspects of forensic work. Other descriptive words that come to mind are: depressing, sophmoric, lurching, disjointed and melodramatic. I do hope that this book was just a temporary lapse on the part of Ms. Cornwell and that she will produce something more palatable next time.",0

I am hoping that there will be a sequel because the mother's story is definitely intriguing and I want to know what happens with her.

The heads on the players look like really big dead ballons in relation to their body size and the crowd animations and grass textures are just plain ugly. As always, the Madden series has excellent gameplay and slick menu systems. John Madden's play by play is really cool. If the developers could improve the graphics this game would be awesome. I like my video games to look as realistic as possible like Doom 3 or Ghost Recon 2. Madden has the gameplay now they have to improve and update the graphics.",0

Everyone likes Mitty. When the terrorists kidnap him to get the smallpox virus scabs to destroy New York City, he uses what he learned from his parents to survive. Kids need to read books about good families and good kids. One of my favorite sections was when his worried sister came home to be with their parents while Mitty missing. A lot of books have single parent households, dysfunctional siblings and emotional problems. Code Orange had a close knit family, siblings who like each other, and an average guy who solved a major problem using his head. Code Orange is my favorite Caroline Cooney book.",1
1644,"Good book with details: I bought this for my pilot husband. He has really enjoyed reading it and likes the mechanical details they list with each disaster. It would be a 5-rating if the book had color, but he can use his imagination with black and white. Good learning/teaching tool.",1
1645,Inspirational: I wish I had this book when I was a young athlete. The author writes clearly and well. She communicates about typical subject manner.

The problems began when I got a 50 disk spindle--so far I burned about 40 and of those I now have 10 very cool looking coasters. I never had such a fail rate before, and I do a lot of burning. I used to use the Kodak Gold, and I was hoping these Memorex Black disks would replace those old favorites...Still, maybe my spindle was a clinker--also, on a couple of the CDs I sucessfully burned, there were skips and strange sounds when I played back on my stereo--I don't mind the occasional flukey CD, but when burning a lot (I run a CDR label) I need consistency and these lovely looking Black CDRs have me wondering.

I thought the pictures would help me with hints so that my ideas could fly. I must say I truly got inspired by the pictures, but this deck is incredibly great and so-so accurate in private questions that I could not believe my eyes!The little booklet is also very helpful and has a lovely appearance, as well as the box the cards came with, so thank you a lot!

I opted to live with roommates to save money, rather than live alone as Erenreich does. I worked really hard, asked for raises and now I make 10.85.

1665,"In this corner, a 1500 pound Marlin...: My fiancée hated this book; she told me it nothing but fish and machismo - futility personified as a short novel. After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her. While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an old man and a big fish, it is more. It is struggle. It is pain and perseverance. It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like victories, and victories defeats.That being said, I can now also say that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain. But it is worth reading, especially if you like the things do not.",0

1667,"A total enjoyment to read: This is probably the fourth or fifth book that I've read on the subject of the Zohar and the Kabballa, and by far the best. It really helps one understand the valuable teachings that are often between the lines in the Torah (especially for someone like myself without a Jewish background and no knowledge of the Hebrew language). This book kept me hooked from start to begining, and I pretty much read it in one setting. And as a bonus note... all the books from the Harpersanfrancisco ""Essential Series"" tend to be valuable and honest introductions to the various spiritual practices of the world",1

1670,"Stunning!: Wow is this author is going to hear from the Religious Right! The novel lays out in very gripping, compelling fashion the hypocrisy and arrogance, self-righteousness and materialism that is rampant in many religious organizations today. Because it is so open and honest, and told with such power and conviction, you find it hard sometimes to believe it's fiction. Highly suspenseful and often terrifying, the story is surprisingly upbeat in the end, with some really astounding twists I never anticipated. No doubt, this will prove to be a controversial novel, but it's a controversy that is long overdue and badly in need of the exposure this worthy novel gives it. A terrific tale, well told!",1

1672,It works!: This is the most positive and helpful material I have found for working with dyslexic children. I tried the techniques Ron Davis outlines this year with an 8 year-old girl diagnosed with dyslexia. She progressed from a Reading Recovery testing level of 6 (PP2) in October to a level of 24 (3.2) in May. We will continue the words/definitions in clay this summer. I was amazed that she understood what I was asking her to do. I'm not sure I understand it because my mind doesn't work that way. I tried just using Reading Recovery techniques but it wasn't enough. She seemed to need to discovery and control her mind's eye. Her body is so much more relaxed and she doesn't rub her feet on the carpet when she can contol her mind's eye. This book offers a way to help children rather than label them.,1

The beeping has gotten so bad that a 5 minute long conversation can have over 10 two-second long beeps.It is very frustrating, especially when I am attempting to take a conference call or trying to make a doctor's appointment and I find myself constantly apologizing for the poor quality of my phone.

In the short time I've been following the DVD, I have felt so refreshed and energized. I do the full DVD from start to finish with no problem. It's so easy to follow and it's the first workout of any kind that I can finish and can't wait to do again! I have a few other DVDs of Raviana's (old and new) and this is by far the best for overall well-being. If you're a beginner, you can do this DVD. You may need to stop early or take breaks on some poses but you will quickly be able to start holding poses longer if you keep doing it. It feels so good!!!

That cute hot guy who you absolutely love but can't have and that best friend who is just a tiny bit crazy. It's purely magical. You'll meet a cupid with attitude and go through this little adventure with a smile. Even now I still catch myself snickering and getting a few weird looks. It's worth a read and great for all ages.,1

Those who do not get excited reading this jewel don't get it and those who do, will pass the teaching on to their deserving children/friends. Those who don't get it are at the kindergarten level trying to read a thesis on physics.

I would prefer to see the books on Core Rules 2.0 and 2.0 Expantion released in this sort of a format as well; being able to see the illustrations is a real plus.I hope WotC does more products like this -- my wish list would be:1. Dungeon Magazine 2. Complete Greyhawk collection 3. Complete Forgotten Realms collection.",1
1685,"To many error to be a useful study guide.: This book was poorly edited. I believe that it is technically correct (unlike other books in the testprep series), but there are so many errors. I did not think that it was proof read before publishing. It slowed my preparation in passing the 70-064, and I can not recommend it on he errors alone",0
1686,Wonderful Product: I absolutely love this product. I received it just in time for the bitter cold football games. Couldn't be happier.,1
1687,"Not mellow: I have A LOT of ""Jazz for a..."" CDs, and this has been my least favorite. The songs really aren't that mellow. I found them to be either too upbeat, or repetative. I liked 'Jazz for When You're Alone' and 'Jazz for the Quiet Times' much better. I never listen to this one.",0
1688,"THE JUICEBOX GOT SPILLED~SAVE YOUR MONEY.: THIS TOY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE. MY 10 YEAR OLD STEP-DAUGHTER PLAYED WITH IT BRIEFLY, AND ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. THEY NEED MORE JUICEWARE IMMEDIATELY.

1689,"Great 2nd album: Slicker then your average: More upbeat, club vibe to it then his first release ""Born To Do It"". Overall at a first listen I liked this one better then his first. With songs like ""Rise and Fall"" and ""fast cars"" heavily played in my cd player. But the reason i gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 though, was because ive only owned it for 2 weeks and i can see the songs getting played out fast, unlike ""born to do it"" which for me never gets old.",1
1690,Good addition to the story: The first book was very up lifting and this one continues to be so. In this one we see what happens if the crows get jealous. This is a very light read and its great to see what happens after everything goes well at the end of the last book. If you liked the first one you like this one.,1
1691,"out with the old, in with the new: I can finally get rid of my old 12"" planer. I used my new Delta 13"" today and it is just great. Everything it said it was and would do and more. Amazon got it to me even faster than I thought they would. What a GREAT company to deal with and look forward to dealing with again. When I had issues, they took care of them right away in my favor. Thank you Amazon.",1

1693,"Can I give less than 1 star?: I used to be a fairly loyal KW fan, but I won't take the chance that she'll write another book this bad. I couldn't finish this. The plot was unbelievably predictable and the heroine was so unbelievable perfect that I found her unbelievably boring.",0
1694,To Whom It May Concern: Great music and talent. Lisa Marie has really matured. Can't wait until the next CD.,1
1695,Not the Usual Home Remodel: The foreign home restoration genre takes a real turn with Tahir Shah's experiences in Casablanca. His patience was amazing. I would have gone stark raving mad. I enjoyed his writing and have gone on to other books written by him. His wife must be a saint to have put up with all of the Caliph's House problems.,1
1696,"Terrible product!!: I have a very small bullseye crack in my windshield (less than .25"") and tried this. The instructions are not great, but common sense helps past that flaw. This product, however, is terrible. Fluid did not penetrate at all in the crack and, in fact, ran down my windshield with the ease of pouring water on my windshield. Product never filled crack, never cured. Definately try something else.",0
1697,Great present: I bought this book for my sister because her name is also Santa. I love the written story in the book as well as the pictures; sheets could be thiner and there could have been more to read and more to look at though. But all in all it is a great book.,1
1698,"Excellent film!: This was dubbed the Star Wars for the 90's and it fell short there. But this movie has excellent special effects, great action, and some nice comic moments. The story was very good and very well thought out. The special effects dazzle the mind with the way the city looked, the vehicles, and the weapons. About the only thing that annoyed me was Chris Tuckers character. I just could not stand listening to his annoying high pitched voice and continual wining. He wasn't always annoying, just 90% of the time. Other than that, the movie maintains a pretty fast pace with some awesome battles. A highly recommended movie.",1
1699,I loved this book as a kid.: Mercer Mayer books are awesome. I purchased this for my son. We're building his book collection (he's only 6 months old now). This is a must have.,1
1700,"is this really tool?: 2.5 STARSim an avid tool fan, and a fan of maynards various projects like apc and puscifer, so i know that his music is hard to live up to. this just didnt cut the mustard. the songs ar alright on their own but you can barely tell that its tool, i was expecting more along the lines of apocalyptica's tributes to metallica. they remain heavy but still keep the string sound. i recommend that over this any day.all in all if you're a classical fan, this might help you get into tool, but not vice versa.",0
1701,"He's definitely written better: I've read all of EJD's books and I find this one to be my least favorite. It took me longer than usual to get into it. I got to a point where I asked myself did I even want to finish it! But as I read I found myself liking it more and more. It was different than his other books and I tried to be open minded, but I don't like this kind of writing from him. Maybe if he'd gone into more detail with the characters? Whatever. I will still buy his books and read them. I'm a loyal fan.",0
1702,"Addressed to wives of alcoholic husbands: The title is dishonest and the book content is sexist. The book is written as though all wives are sober and only husbands are drunks (at least, every page I looked at, because of that problem I did not buy the book). The subtitle should say ""A guide for women who live with an alcoholic husband"" (rather than what it does say, ""A guide for those who live with an alcoholic""). I had hopes of finding a good book for a male friend dealing with his destructively drunk wife. So far each book I have found whose title sounds promising ends up being addressed to the woman dealing with a drunk husband.For women dealing with alcoholic men, what I paged through looked decent, but the book will be a real misfire for those who bought it on the title alone.",0

1705,"This DVD is like a box of chocolates...: We all know this movie so I won't waste time giving you a summary of the plot. What I will tell you about is the wonderful DVD. Seeing this picture with DVD-quality picture and sound is worth the investment right htere. It gets better though. There are so many extra features you won't know what to do. Loaded with documentaries, pictures, behind-the-scenes featurettes and even the screen tests for the actors, you will be entertained for hours after enjoying one of the greatest pictures ever made.Why 5 stars?:When you put in this DVD you will begin by watching one fo the greatest movies ever made. Then, you will be able to continue the expereince by learning more about the film through all of the extra features it includes. Definitely worth the investment.",1
1706,"Perhaps not so fantastic in retrospect: I've read many of Kurt Vonneguts books. I consider him to be my favorite writer and it is through this work that I was first introduced to American Pop writing. To me, then it was a very special little book. That's why it makes me a little sad when I reflect over it now a few years later and realise that its not really as fantastic as I once thought. Vonnegut betrays his science fiction background in a book that sprawls out of control. In places Cat's cradle reverts to a 'then this happened, then this as well' style that is immature and unappealing to the reader. This book does have its moments. An excellent introductary correspondence with the son of Dr Hoenikker, the invention of Bokononism; a religion based purely on untruths, which serve to show the creativity which Vonnegut is capable of anyone considering reading this might do better to read 'Slapstick(or lonesome no more)' which to my mind is a far superior book.",1

1708,"An impressively researched, superbly written and quite original perspective of the complete history of the state Texas: Road, River, And Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas Country's Path From Farm To Supersuburb by Linda Scarbrough is an impressively researched, superbly written and quite original perspective of the complete history of the state Texas. Scarbrough's depiction of Texas' history is outstanding for its individuality and historical documentation in that its approach is of a philosophical outlook more oriented to the political reasoning for Texas' development. A highly notable and strongly recommended read, Road, River, And Ol' Boy Politics is an excellent read for historians of American history in general and students of Texas history in particular.",1
1709,"LIGHTNING ROD: ROD STEWART-THE VERY BEST OF ROD STEWART: This is probably the most comprenensive single disc collection of the Mod one's defining moments. Covering three decades, VERY BEST contains nothing but...never equaled debut chart conquerer MAGGIE MAY...much maligned disco stab DA YA THINK I'M SEXY...nifty Motown duet THIS OLD HEART OF MINE with the peerless Ronald Isley...wistful ditty OOH LA LA first performed by Rod's old mates Faces.

Always a fine interpreter of outside material, his definitive covers of Tom Wait's DOWNTOWN TRAIN and Van Morrison's HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY are exquisitely rendered in that charmingly unmistakable rasp. The only quibble is that more prime pieces such as THE FIRST CUT IS THE DEEPEST, STAY WITH ME, PEOPLE GET READY failed to make the final cut...but that's what sequels were invented for.RATING: FIVE CROAKS",1
1710,"The one King book I didn't finish...: I have read at least a dozen titles by King including some of his best like Salem's Lot, The Stand, It, The Talisman, 11/22/63, and more. This was the only King novel that I couldn't get through. His descriptions of the terrifying attacks on the helpless protagonist (Paul Sheldon) were so thoroughly terrifying, I couldn't go on. All of which isn't to say it's not a great book. It's just that this time...for me...I couldn't finish it. A little TOO real world if you get my take.",1

1714,"I don't see the big deal: This game has to be one of the most overrated ones in recent history. The graphics are simple, 2D, and not very detailed. The least Ensemble could have done is add visual effects, such as weather, to make the game realistic. The civilazations give you close to no variety except for one unique unit which doesn't make a big difference and some special abilities that don't make a difference either. There is also too much micromanaging that you must do to suceed which gets boring after about ten minutes. I played this game for about three days and stopped because it just got frustrating. With four different resoures the game can get very time-consuming and complicated. Add that to wimpy weapons and a lack of strategic elements and you have one pointless game that takes up a ton of unesscesary time. Go buy Tiberian Sun instead.",0
1715,"Yet More Tiresome Egocentric Songs From An Ex Percodan Addict!: The Theme of this album seems to be about ""Growing Old"" which no doubt Ms. Simon can relate to well.In the track ""Have You Seen Me Lately?"" she uses the same old line about ""Falling back on dreams"" which is heard on one of her earlier albums. Don't ask me which one. After awhile they all start to sound the same to me. Perhaps Ms. Simon is running out of original lyrics to write. However as usual, ad infinitum and ad naueaum Ms. Simon sings about How Great She Thinks She Is In Bed with the track ""Better Not Tell Her"". Then of course there is the ironic song ""Waiting At The Gate"" which is about a celebrity getting out of Rehab. No doubt Ms. Simon can relate to this well too. I give this album 5 stars because the cover shows what great work the hair, makeup and camera guys can do to a woman over 50.",0
1716,Clogs quickly: We have only had this showerhead for one month. Already the nozzles are clogging. The spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall. Do NOT purchase this product if you have hard water.,0

1718,"load, reload, and pull the trigger fellas...its over: I thought load and reload were bad. Now I'm begging for their return. There's no difference between this [stuff] and any of the nu-metal [stuff] thats been so popular lately. I popped ride the lightning into my cd player just to remember what they used to sound like. This isnt a return to anything, just another.... attempt by the band to evolve into something more mainstream. This cd has no solid intro's, no good guitar solo's, and no good lyrics. Some people are saying the drums are really good on this album, but all it sounds like to me is a five year old banging on a pot with a spoon. Even the best song on the cd, St. Anger, is worse than anything they've ever produced before. Hetfield's voice is just horrible. I can't stand what they've turned into; a bunch of money grubbin' has beens. I own every cd they've ever made but I refuse to buy this one. Maybe I'll download it - just to pay homage to the band and their recent efforts.",0

1720,"Satisfactory Orc-only set: For $39.99 the set was a good price. The inclusion of four mini-figures, more than 300 bricks, and several unique bricks made the purchase worth the price. If I have made the set the only thing I would have changed is that I would have excluded one of the Mordor Orcs and included Saruman.",1
1721,"Got it one-third through the book: Did they leave out the last page? Predictable plot very early on in the book. Intensely beautiful language, where else can you find ""autochthonous"" and ""gallimaufry"" used repeatedly in one little quarter-inch thick book? Stay away from those catalog book reviews!",0
1722,"This is gonna be big: Hmm it seems that there are no samples for these guys but it doesnt matter, there is no dissapoitment here. Think energetic rock, not quite punk but not quite mainstream. Fast beats, good lyrics, good singer. The sound is so crisp and the levels are so perfect you won't believe it. The recording is super professional. These guys are from socal around orange county somewhere and if you live there you'd probably have a better chance of recognizing them because they're still local. I dont know why the cd costs so much but i swear it is worth purchasing. They might be on itunes, they were a few months ago but not sure if they are now. Support some local rockers!",1

1724,"The worst ""Clancy"" book yet :-(: Clancy and his publisher need to find another ghost writer for this ""Power Plays"" series. It was dull dull dull reading. Also, there were enough enough technical ""bloopers"" to further supress any suspension of disbelief. For example, why would the U.S. Navy keep their encryption keys at a commercial facility, especially one that is overseas? How does a Japanese-American pass herself off as the sister of a Chinese woman?There was some amusement, I suppose, in reading about the antagonist, who is a Harvard-dropout billionaire chairman of a monopolistic computer software firm, get his in the end.",0

He has a no-nonsense and logical approach that makes his advice worth listening to. Heeding to the advice, as he says, is upto you.Why give him a name- conservative,liberal etc? Just read the book and think about it. I am sure you will agree that we are all deep down unscrupulous, materialistic, seek instant gratification, idolize celebrities...and the list goes on.

The second tale is titled CHARLOTTE'S KITTEN. A lady becomes a widow when her husband falls from his mount while away with friends. A small gray kitten appears to care for widow and the mount. The last tale is LORD TREVOR'S TOMCAT and is about an ugly, black tomcat, adopted by Lord Trevor, who ends up leading a young lady to ruin.***** Three Regency tales by authors Janice Bennett, Patricia Bray, and Cathleen Clare.

If so I might have expected a little more gusto, I mean sure there's a lot of over the top ranting and chest thumping but backed up with so little wit or even intriguing spittle that I was unable to suppress a yawn. Why is that the lunatic edge of the conservative movement seem so much like babies playing with their own pooh? It is of that intellectual level and about as imaginative. This guy used to hang out with Allen Ginsberg, which does make me wonder if he isn't having a little laugh at everyone's expense but sadly I don't think this guy has it together enough for that.Also what is striking about a book like this is how much it resembles Pravda the old Communist organ of Mother Russia, same sort of boiling invective, same reactionary fervor. Ultimately Michael Savage strikes me as a fourth rate Stalin wannabe. Congratulations.",0

1738,"Response To Shadow: This Shadow reviewer said that Eminem made fun of more people than Michael Jackson: Madonna, Nysync, Moby etc. Fair enough, but wait. You must remember something.Did Eminem puke on them? Did he pull their noses off? Did he imply they were criminals? Michael Jackson is innocent, and having Eminem trying to defame the biggest selling artist in history is completely immature and shows that Eminem ""has NOT grown up"".However, I may be one of the BILLIONs of MJ supporters slamming Eminem, but I must say, I've listened to this piece of junk. My friend owns it, but she too, was dissapointed. She sold it to the used CD store.""Like Toy Soldiers"" and ""Puke"" are just immature, and shows that he has ran out of material and substance. ""Mosh"" is completely silly, and yet, stupid.So, Eminem's career looks like it has haulted to the stop...though he tried to do that with MJ. However, MJ is invincible, and obviously, doesn't take crap from amateur entertainers.",0

Now all I need to do is wait for something Paranormal to happen and cause the two senors to trigger this flashlight into turning on. Let's only hope I live long enough for that to happen. This is a great light weight flashlight. I will warn you not to look into the light as it is bright enough to burn your retinas.,1

None of them were much help for anything but the bare basics of how to brew your first beer. Then I found this book. Palmer answered all of my questions and made the vague parts of brewing clear. His organization and writing style are excellent. I have brewed a lot of beer since buying this book, and I still find myself referring back to it often. Overall, this is a great book for the beginning and intermediate brewer. You can brew a lot of beer before you outgrow the content of this book.",1

If you like killing for no reason, watching decent people murdered, and an ending with no closure... perhaps this is for you. It was not for me! The only thing I CAN say, is the acting was okay.

This is an overly postive book that is unrealistic and does not work in the real world. For example, could the right words be harsh words with a negative tone that made the person act in a certain way? The answer is yes, but not one example exists in the book and this makes the book feel like a press release rather than a credible biography.

If there was a particular season of Ranma to buy, this one's gotta be it. There is nothing more funny than watching the introductions of all the wacky and zany characters of the Ranma universe. From the lustful Kuno to the hopelessly lost Ryoga, the laughs are limitless. Very highly recommended.",1
1760,"Very good product - it just took a long time to arrive: The Pik Stik is a classic and the price can't be beat. Even though I had to wait longer than I wanted to for delivery on this purchase, the product was worth the wait. I called customer service about delivery and it was back-ordered which would have been nice to know online. One of my pet peeves is that the online quantity on-hand should be accurate. Anyway I couldn't live without it so I am happy.",1
1761,"Not Organized.: There might be a lot of good stuff in this book, but the author doesn't have the skill required to organize it into something useful. A lot of the stuff on the cd simply won't work on my computer, which is a pretty common Windows Pentium. Instead of writing about Elements II the authour should be reading about how to write.",0
1762,"Too big a heal for me: The shoe has quite a bit of heal to it, much more than I'm used to, so I sent them back. If you like a big heal buy them. They appeared well built.",0
1763,"Fun for Starters: Bought this for my daughter since she loves crafts. The instructions are a bit hard, but we are figuring out together. So far we are only able to do the most basic. We will try to find a video online to learn more. Aside from that though, it's a nice starter kit with different colors and cute organizing basket.",1
1764,"PASSIONATE LOVE: THIS WONDERFUL LOVE STORY WAS TRULY AMAZINGLY BETWEEN LORD MILSTEAD ""FITCH"", WITH THE LOVELY VIRGINAL HILLARY, WHO WAS RAISING HIS CHILD, HE NEVER KNEW ABOUT, TIL NOW. GOOD READ!!!!",1
1765,"UGH!: Okay, this may be real. This may be what's really out there. Does that mean it's good?. God no. Some people give praise to awful trash movies like this simply because their true. Because they can and have happened. This is a disturbingly disgusting and vile film that unwatchable from the get go. Even something as awful as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" seems like Oscar material compared to this.",0
1766,Animals and heart attacks: So silly. Elephants are totally different than humans. The author is not comparing apples to apples here. Let's get real..,0
1767,"Audacity of Hope: Mr. Obama is a great writer who conveys his thoughts easily and with candor. He has many good ideas and has credibility. He speaks of a unified Government, not drug down by Party holds. This is a great book and should be in every American's library! If he chooses to run for the Presidency, I will vote for him. I do not view him as a black Democrat but as a man who cares enough about our Country to offer his wealth of knowledge and abilities! It IS time for a change!",1
1768,"great fan: This is a high quality fan. It gives off a powerful blast of air. The fan doesn't take up a lot of space, which is great. The sound that comes from the fan is medium volume, which is perfect. It's loud enough to block noises such as loud talking coming from the neighbors, but the fan is not loud enough to be annoying to you.",1
1769,"Second Time Around: In Alice Wootsons Dream Wedding, high school sweethearts Jimmy Tanner Scott (Jimmy T.) and Melissa Miranda Harrison (Missy) are dating, plan to be married, and love each other for life. However, this relationship ends abruptly when Missy leaves South Carolina to attend college in Philadelphia.Five years later Missy returns home to South Carolina to take a teaching position and have her dream wedding. The turn of events leading to her perfect day will have you on the edge of your seat.Ms. Wootson's Dream Wedding is a lazy, slow moving, touching love story that takes us from the present to the past and back to the present using senior characters to give sage advice.Looking for a sweet love story with a touch of class read Dream Weeding.",1
1770,"Not pure shea butter: I'm almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it's grade F. The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over. Back to the smell, I can't even begin to try and describe the smell, I just remember that it made me want to throw up. Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not. I stopped using it for that reason I never sent it back because I was too lazy and didn't feel like it.",0
1771,Excellent!: One of their best CDs! Great classics from one of the longest running hard rock bands ever. Australian Masters of the Rock Scene.,1
1772,Intex Comfort Bed - Rising Comfort Twin Airbed with built-in Electric Pump: Shipping was great the air bed needs to be pumped up before each use: in other words it does not stay firm durning a nights sleep.,0
1773,"Nine Ab Exercises: I didn't find this DVD very useful. The routines are boring, and the instructor is annoying. He sits in front and does one or two of each exercise while counting by drawing out each number ""onnneeee, twwwoooo...,"" and then he gets up and watches the girls for the rest of the set. Each routine is just three sets of three exercises. The warm-up is pointless; it's just running in place. Once you learn the exercises, there is no need for the DVD, which does little more than count for you.",0
1774,"So glad I discovered Phillips, Craig, & Dean: I heard the song ""Will You Love Jesus more"" at a friend's funeral and I knew I had to have that song.I think I listened to that song 20 times in a row. Beautiful! Their message, their harmony, the instrumentals, definitely God's hand in their music.",1
1775,great book: this is a great book!I agree that there are better methods for training a dog. but that is not what this book is about. It is about dog phsychology.Another reviewer noted that the pack instinct doesn't exist in the domesticated dog.I believe that the pack instinct does exist and it is nesissary to become a pack leader in your home.,1
1776,"Good info, poor presentation.: This book has a lot of great information on the various techniques of preserving, from canning, both with and without a pressure cooker, to freezing and dehydrating food. It also has many, many recipes for each technique of preservation, they all sound so good, but there just isn't enough time! The one main drawback for me was the presentation. The book itself just has a flimsy feel to it, something closer to a thick fashion-like magazine, as apposed to a sturdy tome, used within a rough-and-tough kitchen. I feel like if I don't write out all the information before hand, I'll end up having to buy this again in a year or so.",1
1777,"Should be titled ""I Hate Bush and Other Thoughts"": For someone who seems to be very perceptive on human relations and seems to have a very close relationship with Jesus, this woman has a disproportionate and illogical hatred of Bush. Perhaps this comes from only having friends that think as she does. When she is writing about her son and her relatives, she is very good but the passages and one-liners about her Bush hatred are hard to get through. I suppose this sort of writing isi a hoot to her Salon readers but it will date the book quickly. When she writes about abortion she is doctrinaire and pedestrian.",0
1778,frontline works great: Frontline really works well controlling ticks /fleas. This is the second year I have used it and it really does keep my dog free from all those nasty pests. I would definitely recommend.,1
1779,"Good price, terrible loop: The loop broke just after a day of owning it but beside that it's a pretty chain. It was a waste of money but I might figure a way to repair this on my own somehow. Returning it would cost too much money. Be sure when you pull the loop back to open it, not go too far, otherwise it'll break (common in chains).",0
1780,"Maybe I'm Nuts....: It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it. And I must say that when I got it, I was expecting a better experience than I got, something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting. However, as opposed to most of the reviews I saw, Delta Force was a huge dissapointment. With horrible graphics (Maybe it's my computer, but they didn't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass) and stupid extras as weapons (see the pathetic explosion from a strike) the game was a massive waste of money. I'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it's so cheap.",0
1781,"Just terrible.: I dont understand why this book is deemed a ""classic"". Holden is the most irritating character I have ever endured. He is a rich, spoiled, whiney kid that thinks he's better than everyone else. I could barely stand getting through the book. The only thing that kept me going was the offchance someone might kill him and end his misery (and mine). Wishfull thinking.The writing of this book is also irritating. Repetitive phrases matched with random, meaningless events. There is nothing special or thought-provoking about this book. Dont waste your time.",0
1782,"Quasi-Perfect Compilation: Unlike the 2003-remake DVD set (greatly criticized because of its erratic episode order), this set (though missing its real 2nd episode, ""Astro vs Atlas"") follows the original Japanese episode ordering, a must for hard-core Astro fans. What I miss here is the US-version opening sequence (instead, they inserted the Japanese opening & credits sequences, accompanied by partial English subtitles you can turn on or off at your own taste); also, they forgot to add the US voice credits (I still wonder who the heck dubbed Astro's voice for the States, but I'm pretty sure neither Candi Milo nor Billie Lou Watt was). Apart from all these flaws, this compile is among the greatest ever made. Even its accompanying booklet, featuring Osamu's bio, is a must.",1
1783,"Too Much Rap: This CD is one of the worst compilations of new pop music on the market today. I received it as a gift from a friend who has no taste in music.Sonique's ""It feels so good"" will send you sailing with her warm, sexy voice, but that's about it. Other songs, like ""Bling Bling"" were not real radio sensations and seem out of place with this collection. Overall, this album is a manufactured piece of garbage.If you want to make rich idiots even richer, then buy this sorry album.",0
1784,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is a great Christmas book. This is about a family that was in the Great Depression.Minnie has 1 brother and 3 sister. I like when the chicken was froze on the trash can. I also like when Dad came home and decrote the house. One of Minnie's sisters Lady was really into fasion.,1
1785,Gotta love a sassy witch.: Awesome read. Full of action and great characters. Kim has created a very cool and believable world here. Jinks is my favorite and now I want a pixy too! :),1
1786,"A must Read!: A masterful blend of Horror, Science Fiction and science fact. This author goes out of his way to research his subject material, making the premise plausible to the point of scaring the reader into thinking ""What if it were true?""",1
1787,"The New Voices of the Revolution: I've loved this book since it was originally published, and I think that it continues to represent a wave of new Queer activists, artists, and cultural workers. It's exciting to see these people continue the important work represented in this book, including (but certainly not limited to) Sherisse Alvarez, Meliza Bañales, Alegria Barclay, Ahimsa Timoteo Bodhrán, Siobhan Brooks, Colin Kennedy Donovan, Qwo-Li Driskill, Uchechi Kalu, Lisa Lusero, Alix Oson, Margot Kelley Rodriguez and of course the editor, Amy Sonnie. I'm sure this collection will continue to be a major contribution to GLBTQ literature.",1
1788,"funfunfun: When I saw the season, I could not stop watching it. I think I finished the entire season in several days. My only complain is that I just want the price will go down.",1
1789,"This is not Contra for the DC!: You are unable to jump in this game. So if you're caught in a cross fire, you will be shot. This happens very often. If you were able to jump, then the game would be a little easier to play.The graphics are weak, and the actions is very repetitive. After 3 days of playing I decided to return it for credit.As another reviewer said, enen if you're finishing your collection of the few remaining DC games, you should stay away from this one.",0
1790,"Excellent, but ...: Ok, it is a 5 star movie. I am watching this for the 3rd time in 2 weeks with my 6 year old twins, a boy who is already playing travel hockey, and a girl who has taken some ice skating lessons. Why 4 stars? I would have liked to have seen some of the last ""friendship game"" with the Canadian and U.S. teams. :-) A very good movie for the entire family. I bought this just based on the reviews here at Amazon. Before seeing this, I didn't know about the real events behind this movie. Did some Googling, and it seems like the movie is actually pretty faithful to the truth.",1
1791,"Insightful description of every relationship: Definitely a book that begs, ""buy me as a gift"". And I will, my best friends birthday is today and she will receive this book when next I see her. There are quotes worthy of posting throughout. My favorite? ""If we can keep each other laughing, we can keep each other sane.""",1
1792,"Well read person gives book four stars: Wow! This was an excellent book by Lawhead. I consider it to be bettered only by Byzantium. I noticed some people were unhappy with the weak plot. I thought it had a good plot with good characters, thought none were strong. It really transported me back to the time period of the Crusades. I do not read books like this for intellectual advancement, but for a combination of entertainment and relaxation. This book is more than sufficient to satisfy these needs of mine.",1
1793,"Highly Questionable ""Interviews"": These ""interviews"" sound nothing like Bette Davis as anyone who ever read the scores of bona fide interviews she gave over the years. Miss Davis was hot-tempered and sharp-tongued at times but her fans know she was really something of a prude so it seems highly questionable she would dish dirt like this. (Remember she had a feud with her last film director because the film included a dark comic joke concerning Joan Crawford which Miss Davis thought was in terrible taste. And Joan was of course no friend of Bette's!!) This frankly reads more like a drag queen's nightclub act not an interview with a star. I don't know a single movie buff who believes Mr. Hadleigh's books.",0
1794,"Felt abit cheated: I have always really enjoyed the Celtic Woman dvds, but this one is just a repeat of the first two albums, that I already own. Had I known, I wouldn't have spent the money in buying a duplicate.",0
1795,"poor dubbing ruins movie: This movie is not like a Jackie Chan flick where the plot and acting are secondary to the action pieces and goofy comedy, so it makes 0 sense for them to dub over the voices in order to make the movie more easily accessable to North American audiences. Besides, Chow Yun-Fat's fame over here is fresh in everyones mind from Crouching Tiger, which was shown subtitled in the theatres, so it's not like people are totally against the idea. There's nothing wrong with release Hong Kong films here to cash in on their recent popularity, just treat them with a little respect ala Time and Tide or Once Upon a Time in China. If you are a fan of Hong Kong movies, or foreign movies in general, please do not support cheesy dubbed versions and skip this DVD, buying it only encourages them to do the same to other films.",0
1796,"Not a Sherlock Holmes movie...: A night and day with the first of this sequel. The characters are too far and away from the spirit of the legend and serve the need for action instead of the other way around. Very disappointing considering the production cost and the great performances. I would call it something else but this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes movie, sorry.",0
1797,great book: this is a great book. really goes into detail about the mob and the teamsters.and i can't wait for the movie the irishman.,1

1800,not worth to buy: i bought this crazy oster and its overheating all the time what a stupid product is this dont buy it .........,0
1801,"A Mixed Bag: I did not like this book and thought it was very wacky. First of all, I did not appreciate the author telling me to think of myself as a crone because I am going through/ in menopause. The writing style was silly-with each chapter beginning with an older voice telling you how you should feel about all the changes going on. It was like a fairy tale. I can not say how accurate the information she gave for vitamins and herbs was but I didn't like when she said never have your ovaries removed and then didn't follow up about what would happen once they are removed. She is very anti hormone and while they may not help some women, they may be the right thing for others. The book goes overboard on natural remedies and does not supply any scientific or medical information to back up her claims. I'm glad I didn't buy this book-instead I took it out from the library. Read this book with a critical mind and don't accept it as truth. It's interesting but I don't believe everything in it.",0
1802,Real dumb: If a Martian came to earth and watched this movie they would think all woman are bitchs and jerks. Miss this one,0
1803,"No smell, no capacity: The first thing this product is meant to do is suppress the smell of diapers. Our son is only 5 weeks, but the Diaper Champ does seem to prevent smells from getting out.But.After the third diaper in the bag, the Diaper Champ jams constantly. Only the most tightly bound and compacted diapers then have a chance of not jamming the mechanism, and even then it's a 50/50 shot. The result is that we often wind up opening the whole top to get the diapers in, which totally defeats the purpose of the item.Not recommended.",0
1804,"no good: I didn't read reviews, just purchased in store. Puppy would check it out but NEVER used it for potty. Even used spray on it. No use! Surprised because I had great respect for simple solution. Maybe they should read these reviews and pull this product.",0
1805,"Wonderful: I had this book in College and it i sone of the reasons I got through school, I just graduated from Yale and where Mr. Kieran has an excellent reputation and I understand was once the Dean of the Architecture School. If you have a real interest in the art he is the master.",1
1806,Can only fit into a diesel tank.: I wasted my money on this because it is too wide to fit into the fuel filler neck on a vehicles' gas tank that is not a diesel.,0
1807,"Everyone's different, but this works for me...: I realize some people will dislike this clock, but if you are looking for a basic clock radio with a CD player, this is just fine. It is small enough to fit on my bedstand, loud enough to wake me up, and has enough options to appease the gadget desire in me.The gradual wake up option alone is worth purchasing this product. Simply put, it allows you a more comfortable waking experience. Let's face it, we all need that. Waking up is bad alone, so if you can make it a bit easier, do it.The sound quality isn't as good as a full-blown stereo system, but what do you expect form a clock/radio? The sound is good enough though.The CD player does seem to play CD-R/RW. So for those with burned CD's there isn't an issue there.Admittedly, I was nervous buying a Phillips brand product, but I will be more eager to buy from them now based on this product.",1
1808,"Avoid at all costs: Sometimes a bad movie can be ""fun"" if you know what I mean, but this is so bad you can't even laugh at it. Mostly I felt sorry for the people ""acting"" in it. Sad, sad, sad. I'm glad George Romero had nothing to do with this. Not even worth a rental.0 stars out of 5.",0

1810,"A big steamy pile: This DVD is a waste of money. For years I've heard about how great the FMW is. I purchased this with high expectations and was let down. The comentators suck like nothing else, the hardcore match with Mr. Pogo is nearly impossible to watch thanks to the brilliant idea of using strobe lighting, and the rest of the matches are mediocre Monday night stuff at best. On the plus side Mike Awsome's hair is at full mulletude. And the bonus stuff is great. Your money is better spent on the ECW DVDs.",0
1811,"Classic from the '80's is Back in Print!!!: Space Race was a classic album when it was released back in the '80's. Fans of The Fixx, early Simple Minds, and Classix Nouveaux should relate well with this cd. This is synth tinged guitar New Wave. Mi Sex was a New Wave/New Romantic band from New Zealand that had a few hits "" Space Race"" and ""Computer Games"". I had both of these albums on vinyl and am quite happy to see these re-released on compact disc. For more info go to www.allmusicguide.com",1
1812,a book worth reading: I absoultely love this book. I've never read something so beautiful yet depressing. The only thing is the end dissapointed me a bit... it didn't seem like it fit. It just seemed like it was slapped on. But trust me this book is worth your time and money. I would read it again.,1
1813,"Not what it appears: This looked like a killer compilation of 80's metal songs, however upon getting it home and giving it a listen you can clearly tell these are NOT the origional recordings of the songs. They are shoddy half-ass remakes. Most are still by the origional band but you can tell they are re-recordings that have none of the energy of the origional recordings.Save your money, even free is too much to pay for this load of junk.",0

1815,"Garmin Euro Maps: I bougth this item in spite of some marginal to bad reviews by other buyers and I regretted it. The previous reviews, saying it didn't play well with Nuvi660, were mostly correct. It took forever (ok 8 to 10 minutes) to load the maps and it wasn't very current with the roads in Spain, which were recently re-numbered. We were continually wondering whether we were on the correct road, which we usually were, but the numbers were wrong. It also miscounted several roundabout exits and had us going off on the wrong road, causing a lot of backtracking. All-in-all not a very representative product of what I expect from Garmin.",0
1816,"JUST DON'T GET IT FROM IMPORTCDS: This is a great soundtrack to a very good movie; just be careful who you buy it from. I ordered 1 copy from a seller called IMPORTCDS. They billed me for & shipped 3 copies. When I contacted them about the error they assured me that as long as I returned the extra 2 copies that they would issue a full refund on all but what I had originally ordered. Over 2 weeks later, I actually got a refund for 1 copy; I've still paid for the 2nd as well as their shipping charge to send me the 2 copies I never wanted in the 1st place. Customer service this is not. DO NOT BUY FROM IMPORTCDS !!!",0
1817,"Like silky, velvet dreams: The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.",1
1818,"JAZZ like never before...: I'm young so I'm not much of a jazz fan but I was with my mother the other day as she played the new Bobby Lyle ""Joyful"". It sounded more like instrumental R&B than jazz. He has one track ""Caught Up"" that I just had to hit repeat for. This track features Howard Hewitt and Jarrard Anthony on vocals. Take it from someone who hated jazz all her life, Bobby Lyle's ""Joyful"" is a must buy CD to add to your music collection!",1
1819,Ladies Shaver Parts: These pieces for my shaver which were new blades worked pretty good. They were sent in a reasonable time. Thanks,1
1820,"TERRIBLE IS TOO NICE A WORD!: I received this CD for free and all I can say is, THANK GOD!!!! This is one of the most irritating albums I have ever had to endure!!! Honestly, I can't give a complete review, as I have never been able to complete the entire album. I keep it close to remind me what happens when musicians start to pander to the musical morons out there who feel repeating the same bass line for seven minutes and knowing how to program a drum machine are the ultimate in musical ability! Apparently all you have to do is throw in some funky sounding temple bells (check out the song Bali High) and you've got something that's danceable. High points on this album are few (read nonexistent). The guy monotonously repeating ""Progress thru chemistry in California living,"" is entertaining for about 12 seconds. If you like your music to have a painfully repetitious quality this album is for you. All others should steer clear! I mean it!",0
1821,"CD2 is amazing: I was lucky to find this album at virgin records. The first cd is disco-tech which is not my thing. Personally, I don't ever listen to the first cd, except when i first bought it. BUT THE SECOND CD IS AMAZING.

The package is terrific, with a high quality booklet with character studies and background art.THAT SAID: Several of the discs don't work -- they freeze, stall or don't load. I tried my computer, my cheap dvd, and a friend's top-of-the-line Denon. The vendor replaced it once cheerfully, then refused to do so again [did offer refund]. Warner Bros videos sent me a blow-off reply saying they didn't manufacture it and didn't sell it, so they won't support it. The manufacturer? Who knows and who can tell. It's not listed.AND OF COURSE: My favorite episodes are on discs that don't work on either of the two packages I have.IT MAY BE WORTH A TRY: But be ready to return it.",0
1823,"Fascinating: This book is a fascinating description of life in times in the Glades, Florida Pioneers and a life forgotten. It will move you, awe you, intrigue you and you will come away with a sense of admiration for the people of the Everglades whether white or black or Indian. It was not an easy life but it was a life full of wildness and freedom. This book provides a rare glimpse into the past and the Florida of yesterday. Well done.",1

1825,"a great book for lovers of Greek Mythology: This is no easy reading, and it is not for people totally without basic knowledge. Harrison, a great scholar who wrote in the 20s, won't tell you who Athena is- you should have a basic idea in order to enjoy the complex stories about her and all the Olympian deities! We didn't get the background told at school, only the stage when belief in the Gods was actually dead, preserved only as a cultural phenomenon. Harrison will tell you about the time when belief was ALIVE. If you want to know about the ceremonies, the secret rites, the hidden names, the shift of power from goddess to god... and in all this in a factual, reliable manner- then this is the book you should read!",1
1826,"Mediocre - Get Eva Cassidy or Diana Krall Instead: I was given this album as a gift, and I know I'm going against the popular grain here, but I have to say it like it is...her over-played radio ""hits"" were tolerable but after playing the overall collection of songs twice it just doesn't inspire me to play the CD again. (My wife says that she sounds like a cat ""yowling"" on a back fence - a little extreme).Fortunately, I had picked up CDs by Eva Cassidy & Diana Krall prior to receiving ""Come Away With Me"" and was blown away by their voices and musicianship...this made Norah Jones' efforts come off weak in comparison. In short...it's fashionable, one note music that's tolerable in the short term but I'll be curious to see if the music endures the test of time or if it goes the way of the ""Pet Rock"".UPDATE: Yep, she went the way of the ""Pet Rock"" - vindicated",0

My 4-year-old son, who, at over three feet tall, is a tad on the long side for it, also enjoys it.I was really looking for a non-plastic ride-on without pedals that would be easy to maneuver in the house and wouldn't be an eyesore.

I was surprised that Terry Brooks did such a good job on this one, and it was good and easy for kids. The only bad part was that it focused on Anakin too much.",1
1833,"Big dustbuster - that's it: I bought this vac for my RV, so it would see relatively light use. Our camper has carpeting, so I needed something that will pick up dirt that gets tracked into the camper. This vac did a fair job on the bare linoleum floor but did horribly on the low pile carpeting. I returned it and just got a Hoover Flair S220. It is a little heavier but does a much better job and still stores in a very small space. It even does a good job with pet hair! I recommend you spend the extra $20 and get the Hoover Flair.",0
1834,"This movie sucks: I watched this in the movie theater and boy was it boring. If this was a thriller, I wasn't thrilled. This is the type of movie you'd show your kids if you wanted them to sleep because it starts of slow and the ending isn't worth waiting for. This is almost like Blairwitch project where they build up the hype and the product ain't tight. I recommend you skip this and buy yourself a homestyle melt in Burger king, its much better.",0
1835,"Ella Fitzgerald is the Queen of Song!: This cd is a must addition to any collection of American popular music.It's Ella at her best (and that was truly THE BEST) and each song is a gem.Verve did a great job at putting this together and Ella sounds fantastic.Ella's Verve years will go down in music history, under the guidance of NormanGranz, Ella sang so many great songs.Order this right now, you'll be so happy.",1
1836,"2 stars for Aniston, ZERO for movie: In less than ten words: Straight girl falls in love with gay male roommate. Jennifer Aniston gives an emotional performance - she does a splendid job of making you really feel for her character Nina, who works with teens in a community center. This movie also features Alan Alda in a supporting role. Does Alan Alda ever shut up?!? Jeez! Furthermore, Paul Rudd's performance (as George the gay roommate) didn't have even a fraction as much emotion as Aniston's performance. The movie could've been MUCH shorter and it had a tad bit too much sugar and Alda is downright annoying.",0
1837,"Fire and forget: This was a breeze to setup, even with WPA2 to ensure privacy. I also hooked up an Xbox360 and it has never failed in since I bought it about 6 month ago.Much better value then your average gaming adaptor since it has multiple ports so you can hook up all your gizmos at the entertainment center rather then buying a wireless adaptor for each (i.e. Tivo, PS2, etc...)I love it, and for the price, you could not beat it.",1
1838,"Hi: Hi!!!Hi again!!! Hi!!! I am half way through this book. It is incrddibly boring and annoying, especially that Elayne. She thinks she's so all that and she's so obsessed with herself that she doesn't know what a [naughty person] she is. I would slap her right now. Bye!!!Bye again!!! Bye!!!",0
1839,Great Science Reference Book: This is a great science reference book for kids 10 and up. It has so much wonderful information and beautiful illustrations. Looking forward to using it when his class goes over this section in school this year (5th grade) for both science and health related studies.,1
1840,"Not up to expectations: Flawed, cliche-ridden movie with plot holes you could drive the steam train through. And the ending is even worse, leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth and feeling ultimately cheated.The PCM soundtrack rocks on Blu-Ray.",0
1841,"Couldn't imagine a better book!: A friend of mine sent this to me in the hopes that I would like it. I didn't want to finish it because I just did not want it to end. Its told in first person narrative, Penelope is a very British 18 year old (Something she gets teased for by her friends) who is madly in love with Johnnie Ray (someone who's fame I had been oblivious to until I read this book, I now know better).The book gets off to a very interesting start with her recounting how she meets her soon to be best friend, Charlotte. And then the story really gets moving, Charlotte's cousin Harry proves a great character and Penelope's brother Inigo is almost as interesting. Slowly the four of them learn about how their families had met up before and how their lives have changed from knowing each other.I can't say enough about this book, it takes itself lightheartedly but addresses some serious issues, living in post WW2 England, rationing, being a teenager on ther cusp of womanhood, its FANTASTIC!",1
1842,"Save your money: The laser line is just not precise enough for most work. Squaring the tape measure to the board you're working on is not accurate enough to produce a nice square laser line. I was off by an eight of an inch within a foot of the tape measure. I could use another tape measure to square the laser line but then, what's the point. Just make a mark with the second tape measure or just buy a laser line square. If you just want a laser line projector, you could use this unit for that purpose and that's why I gave it two stars instead of one.",0
1843,Not Without My Daughter: This is a powerful movie. I have watched it several times. It isvery moving and keeps your attention. Makes you appreciate our greatUSA.Earthmomaw,1
1844,LAST DVD was BAD SCRATCHED: The last DVD was totally defective. There is nothing worse than to miss out at the end of a movie or novela. I could not return it because my time to return had expired! This is not the product you can just check right away unless you watch it.,0
1845,Blow it Away!: This cd is by far the worst bunch of recorded music ever.I don't think it should even have one star.What the hell is a Personal Holloway anyway?,0
1846,"Okay but not pleasant: ""Deconstructing Beck"" is a semi-legal release where such people as ""Corporal Blossum"" and ""Spacklequeen"" blend many Beck songs into 13 tracks. The results mostly sound like flipping a radio dial and at over over 50 minutes, the album runs a bit too long.",0
1847,"A great album: This is a really nice ambient album, the kind of album you can close your eyes and think while listening to it, also a good album to go to sleep to. If you like ambient music buy it, if you haven't heard ambient buy it to see what ambient is.",1
1848,"Best bread machine in its class: After doing much research on bread machines and narrowing down the choices by price range and feature, the Sunbeam was the best bread machine in its class. I have baked many loaves of different breads in the three months I've owned it and the interface is simple and easy to use. I loved the bread machine so much that I got one for my mom for her birthday and she loves it!",1
1849,"Ugh. Don't even rent this one.: To be fair, I didn't view this entire movie. I couldn't finish it. Although the camera work is lovely, the costumes are beautiful and accurate, and Ms. Mol made a fabulous Bettie, this movie does not do the famous pin-up queen any justice. Flashbacks of her early life are pitiful-poor young Bettie the victim is mistreated by one man after another, pouting and crying. She was a strong woman in reality, but this film presents her as an abused creature to be pitied. Although it is never stated, the movie implies that the reason she got in to fetish modeling was a direct result of her abusive and tumultous childhood. Blech. This film is rather entertaining to look at but if you really want to get a sense of who Bettie Page was, look somewhere else.",0
1850,"Good Sized, Works Fast: This panini press has two distinct advantages over larger and more expensive models--namely, it is smaller and less expensive! As panini are usually made one at a time anyway, getting a multi-sandwich sized machine is just a waste of counter and storage space. This press has room for two sandwiches if you want to cook more than one at a time, but it is compact and easy to put away. It heats up quickly, and works like a waffle iron--one light says ready to go, the other says wait a minute. Pretty simple.The floating handle provides even pressure on sandwiches, which come out warm and deliciously crunchy. One warning for households with small kids--the whole unit (except for the handle) gets pretty hot.This is a satisfactory low cost panini maker that is perfect for singles, couples, or even small families.",1
1851,Perfect for the price: It's just right for checking out small things like some product instructions. Handy thing to have around the house. Glad we bought it.,1
1852,"Drivel: I saw the Zanders speak and read their book. He is unbearably narcissistic. She seems thoughtful if a bit vague and trite. Unfortunately he runs the show. He is much like the seminar leader in Jim Carrey's film ""Yes Man."" The message of their talk and book is basically a version of ""Say yes to everything in life and the world will be your oyster."" As Jim Carrey finds out, no it won't. I would suggest that others not waste their $.",0
1853,"I have to agree with the majority: Its terrible, in most aspects. There are three good songs, the rest just suck.Eat you aliveBuild a BridgeBehind blue eyesThose are the only good songs. Limp Bizkit is the biggest example of how alot of bands start out good and just get progressively worse, never rising back up again. 3 Dollar bill ya'll was awesome, Significant Other was great, Hot Dog was ""eh"" and the new one is just bad.",0
1854,"Not for the faint of heart!: This heartstopping end to the two book story about Jack the Ripper written by Ms. Douglas has heart-stopping action from the beginning to the end. The book continues the story of Irene Adler's search for her missing husband and her missing companion. The book flips back and forth from Irene and her group and to Nell and Godfrey who are being held captive in a decaying castle in Transylvania. This is a much darker story than Chapel Noir, but the plot is gripping, and as always, Ms. Douglas' period detail is wonderful. I know that I couldn't put the book down. There's not much mystery in this one though, but the theories that are put forth as to the identity of Jack the Ripper are intriguing. This is a wonderful series and Irene Adler is a great character.",1
1855,"A wonderful book: This is one of my daughter's books that I don't mind reading over and over again. At four, she's memorized the story, and at bedtime I'll read the bunny's names (""1 was named Abel..."") and she'll supply where they sleep (""...he slept on the table.""). She loves the rhymes, and the rhythm is lovely and even--making it good for bedtime story reading! This has also led to a great game: when we're in the car or I need something to occupy her, I can give her the bunny's names, and she'll tell me where they sleep.The illustrations are very nice, and I like that all the bunnies appear together with their Mom at the end; we enjoy looking for the various bunnies there.Highly recommended!",1
1856,"Gardener/ canner/ housewife: We have now had the food grinder for about a month. We LOVE IT! I don't even plan on using it for meat, so the reviews I saw about the metal shavings did not concern me. We use ours to process vegetables. Zuchini, peppers, onion, pickels, etc. Also for shredded cheese! We have canned over 100 quarts this summer with no problems at all, no metal, or anything going bad. I do recommend not pushing hard on the food feeder, or the juices will get you. Also, don't use past medium speed. Juices spray. I love this addition to my stand mixer!",1
1857,"West With the Night: West With the Night is a reflection by Beryl Markham of her years as an African bush pilot. Filled with lush description of an Africa in the early 1900s, the book takes the reader on an aerial and informative view of a raw but beautiful continent. The story gently tells of several harrowing experiences and unlikely friendships. Knowing nothing about the author, who was the first person and woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean from England to North America, or the book prior to my book club choosing it, I was pleasantly surprised at the end.",1
1858,"Not So Hot...: If you take 50's debut CD and all thats he's been saying about how great this new jaunt is, you'd obvioulsy expect it to be hot. I was way beyond dissapointed when I heard this CD. Its pretty much just average, the songs are alike, and it all just kinda runs together. The lyrical content is just not there. I dont know what happened with this, but I really wouldnt bother with it. It kinda makes sense all the beef with Game just started going down before he dropped this. It's gonna sell records. Cause after people hear this, his sales aren't gonna be so good. Thats my opinion, but I think he coulda done much better. If you wanna hear this CD, get a bootleg or download it, dont waste your money.",0
1859,"completely satisfied: The guitar book that I ordered arrived on time and in perfect condition, exactly as promised.",1
1860,"Not Sure...: I like to think of myself as pretty tech-savvy and I have yet to find a machine that this will play on. DVD player, PC, PS3... Tried it in all of them and it hasn't played in a single one. Just spits it back out without being able to recognize the disc. Ah well, get what you pay for I suppose.",0
1861,"Great!: Sophie Kinsella is a GREAT story teller. I would read the phone book if she wrote it. This book is yet again, a great easy read. Highly recommend.",1
1862,"perfect: just as i expected. I bought it for elinchrom flashes, it fits tight, but fits and its cheaper than elinchrom honeycomb grid set",1
1863,"NOT WORTH IT!!! READ ANYTHING ELSE!: I stopped reading it at the 200th page. I got over reading it really fast. I truely tried and hoped it would get better and some how catch my attention but it did not. The stories in between the main storie were not half bad but all together it was confusing, boring and not worth reading. When you cannot get to like any of the characters theres a problem. This is the first and only books i have never finished, that says something since i have read hundreds of books.",0
1864,"Brings back Memories.: I remember the first time I watched this I had just started first grade. I cried and it still brings me to tears over Mufasa. It is an all time classic and probably the greatest children's movie of all time so when I saw it coming out on DVD i knew i had to get it to share a part of my childhood with my niece and nephew. Also, admittedly I had to get a copy for myself too. It is one of those children's movies that you never outgrow and for everyone in the family.",1
1865,"Very Boring!: I rented this movie recently and I was told it was an action/comedy. If you ask me, it is more of a drama/action. It is not really a comedy. I got very bored during this movie. If you are into dramas and actions you'd like it. But for me, it was a waste of time and money.",0
1866,"I should send it back: Most of the useful advice in this book could have fit into a magazine article. They go on far too long about the pitfalls of flame wars, misused ""reply to all"" responses and similar horrors and hilarities of email.",0
1867,"Good movie minus the pornography: Let's just call it what it is, most modern movies are basically pornographic because we've become desensitized and don't value sex anymore. That said, this is a great little movie and at least shows the consequences of promiscuous sex, unlike most American films which glorify it.",1
1868,"Fugazi Madness: Once again the boys from Fugazi have come back with a great record. Consistancy and innovation are always present when Fugazi goes to work. With the state of music in flux a truly great American band still puts out quality, hard hitting music!",1
1869,"Let Down: Don Winslow seems to write in two completely different voices, voices so different that it is hard to believe these books are by the same person. If you liked ""California Fire and Life,"" you will be very disappointed in ""Power of the Dog."" If you liked ""The Death and Life of Bobby Z,"" then you may enjoy ""The Dog.""Unfortunately, the voice I liked was the original, snappy one that gave ""California Fire and Life"" one of the sparkiest openings I've ever read. ""Bobby Z"" seemed standard and disappointing-albeit busy and bloody-and I didn't finish it. ""Power of the Dog"" covers twenty-five years of battling Mexican drug cartels, including the death-by-torture of DEA agent Enrique Camarena in the 1980s. Ambitious, but ultimately pretty standard. If you want a really, really scary look at the Mexican cartels, read Arturo Perez-Reverte's ""Queen of the South.""",0
1870,"Classic: This album is one of my favorites, next to Masekela's latest. everyone needs to check this album out. best songs: in the jungle, colonial man, excuse me baby, and the boy is doin' it.",1
1871,"Overpriced junk: This pen case is greatly overpriced and of inferior quality. The fabric liner is very thin and feels and looks cheap. I will be surprised if the zipper lasts more than a few months. The label says it all - ""MADE IN CHINA"". I will never again buy anything from this vendor.",0
1872,"My fave Zep album.: This is my favorite Zeppelin album. ""Out on the Tiles"" is one of my fave Zep songs, (really funky drumming) along with ""That's the Way."" I would recommend this album, highly, mainly because except for ""The Immigrant Song,"" it is largely ignored by the radio, so you probably haven't heard these songs one trillion times already.",1
1873,"DOES WHAT PROMISSES AND MORE!: I'm 58 years old and I've been taking this supplement twice a day for a month and a half to prevent Alzheimers.I've noticed an increase of mental wellness and decided to read more about its properties.Curcumin is a powerful antioxidant, improves mental functions, reduces stress, depression and anxiety and has anticancer properties as well.I don't review supplements but this one deserves one.Swanson is a trust worthy brand and this product always arrived fresh to me.Highly recommended!",1
1874,"Simply Amazing: This first release by Lennon Murphy takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions that you will never want to end. The album 5:30 Saturday Morning starts off with the powerful guitar packed Property of Goat Fu%&er and the First single of the Album, Brake of Your Car. And climaxes with the title track 5:30 Saturday Morning a piano led ballad that touches every listener with in the opening verse. Lennon captures the deep and painful feelings of relationships gone wrong, and turns them into everything from rage building metal to soothingly beautiful rock ballads. Not many artists create masterpieces such as this over an entire career, but Lennon has succeeded at doing so in her first attempt. If you do not own this cd you are missing out on what could possibly be the best rock album of the year.",1
1875,"Great Pan: This has been a great pan! I love the non-stick! I'm glad I found it, and for a great price!",1
1876,"Undiscovered Treasure Discovered: This is one of those unfortunate ""lost in the shuffle"" discs that ends up in that graveyard of unsold music - the cutout bin. It is unfortunate because this talented group has put together one of the most well crafted discs of the year. The fine craft of pop songwriting is alive and well with Mary Lee's Corvette. Wonderful melodies along with excellent lyrics propel this pleasurable disc. At times it reminds me of Merrill Bainbridge's debut disc, which was also a wondeful collection of pop music. From the chugging opening track of ""Need For Religion"" to the bittersweet finale of ""Lost Art,"" there is not a dog in the bunch. I hope this is a group with a future because they deserve it and I'm sure that the best is yet to come.",1
1877,I wish it was longer.: I just finished it and I've got a great big smile on my face. It starts out slow but by the end you want more. Thats half the fun imagining what will be next. If your the earthy type this series is a must read. My all time favorite set of books. Get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime. If the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long.,1
1878,Film review: Enjoyed the movies and it brought back memories that were most enjoyable. Good story with a wonderful ending. Recommend the movie to anyone who likes a slightly unusual story without the rubbish of today's films.,1
1879,"exelent,must have in your collection: I'm big fan of Miles Davis,but when I browse with MP3Spy refering to your server I was sooo threeled.Far before so called new age music Davis and the crue find it.The music sounds so misterious,so rich and of course Davis divine tromphet does the rest.It's musical extasy and heaven to listen to this album.I defenetely considering to buy the album.",1
1880,"Of course it's not top quality, but it's a good bang for your buck.: I would totally recommend this to anyone just getting started with yoga. I'm sorry, but mats, blocks, straps, etc are pricey. And this is a really good deal, getting everything for such an inexpensive price.If you find that yoga's for you, you would probably want to upgrade, especially as your usage increases, but I can't say enough what a good deal I think this is. The cheapest mat I found was $20, so I really think it's worth the extra $6 to get a bag, blocks, and strap too.I noticed some of the comments said the bag is flimsy. Well, no it's not top strength nylon or anything, but how sturdy do you need a bag that's carrying 3 lbs to be?I guess what I would take from all of this, is that if you're a yoga guru or someone who has money to blow-go get a nicer, pricier set. If not, this is the perfect set for you.",1
1881,"Break up: This movie is a blast. Kinda reminds me of a few relationships in my past, it's something to relate to. Scary but true!",1
1882,Life savers!: This is my lil' sisters favorite toy. She got it when she was a baby and it broke. i didn't know where to go to get her a new. they had it when no one else did and its exactly the same as when she was lil' perfect and hopefully it won't break for another 9 years.,1
1883,"A Must For Guitar Fans: Staggering. That is the only word to describe this album with. If you are a fan of solo guitar, then this album is the ultimate. Three of the geniuses of the instrument strut their stuff with their band for 3 songs apiece, and then, finally, all get on stage together and jam on three covers (with vocals no less). Personally, I like Steve Vai's set the best, closely followed by Satriani's. Johnson takes a more subtle route, bypassing most of the high-flying guitar pyrotechnics that his partners in crime use, showing that he is a true master of the instrument. All three jams are great, but the closing near 10 minute cover of Jimi Hendrix's Red House, with Johnson on vocals is the highlight of that set, and possibly the album, rivaled only by Vai's For The Love of God. Needless to say, this is an album to get if you are a fan of either three of these guitarists, or guitar soloing in general.",1
1884,"Works beautifully!: I've been using this press daily for about a month, and I love it. It is rugged, goes in the dishwasher nicely, and makes a great cup of coffee. I don't have a coffee grinder (YET!) so I'm using store-bought pre-ground coffee. I have never had grounds in my cup - the filter is really good. And I love that it keeps the coffee warm, so that my second cup is ready for me, even an hour later. I highly recommend this product!",1

1888,"it was the kids: i always wondered if mann was a truly gifted artist or if her subjects and locations were just so compelling that anyone could have captured incredible images if they happened to be present.this book confirms the latter.these photographs are flat, uninteresting, not compelling for me in any way.Maybe she needs to find some new prepubescent girls and go back to the child-erotica.The controversial nature of her images were what vaulted her to fame.it surely was not talent.",0

1891,Good book.: Excellent for what I needed. Easy to understand and well developed book. It comes with interesting readings. I will recommend it.,1
1892,"Beautiful dress but....: I got this dress for a school dance, it fit well, and it was beautiful. Even though I could not tie the bow like it was in the picture, it was still gorgeous. The only negative thing I have to say about this dress is that after two hours of wear, the whale bone in the corset part started scratching my skin and at the end of the night I had cuts covering my under arm. The cuts healed and everything is fine, but just keep that in mind if you're going to be dancing and wearing this dress for a long period of time.",1
1893,"Cute: Cute little night light that goes well with the rest of the set. My daughter had most of the pieces to the Gossamer Wings set, but this piece didn't last too long. The plastic is pretty thin, and it broke easily when bumped... perhaps not a great idea for a child's bedroom.",1
1894,Great Rock N Roll CD: I bought this cd in 1992 when it was released and played the living death out of it on college radio. This is still a cd that I throw on once and awhile and still enjoy immensley. Worth picking up for the price listed here. Worth every penny.,1
1895,"Timeless Stories!: This book has all of the stories from my childhood. Little Golden Books has taken 46 of their best loved children's stories and put them in to one book, everything from ""The Poky Little Puppy"" to ""Scruffy the Tugboat"" are included. Even if you are trying to find a book for a little one or if you remember these stories when they first came out, these stories will make you smile. I highly recommend this book to everyone!",1
1896,"Tight Game, but its missing something: I hate video games, but DDR is to good to be considered a video game. This game has helped me build stamina and quick thinking skills. DDR Konamix has an awesome song list with the original Paranoia and this is the only US release which features the very complicated Orion.78[AM-EuroMix] So why would I give it four stars? Because you can't use speed modifiers.[x1.5,x2,x3,x5,x8]I know most DDR fans don't really care something like that, but some songs on here are impossible to do with only one speed.This game is still a good buy, but I recommend DDRMAX or DDRMAX2 over this one.",1
1897,"Crystal & Gems for healing, spirit, & ascesion!: Diane Stein has gone deeper lately into healing, spirituality, and ascesion. I have always loved her Goddess spirituality books, but these are even better! Now when I shop for stones I can get more appropriate stones for healing, etc. Even though the book is small, it is worth its weight in gold!",1

I have this stacked on top of the matching Amp from the same company, (they hook up easily and work well together, built for each other).This is my first compressor that had all the adjustments, and it took a while to find the best settings. To my less experienced ears, I'd adjust the knobs till I could hear a difference, than set the knob to the middle of the range that sounded the same to me.I use this mostly on a female voice. Each voice and instrument needs a different setting (which is why they provide so many knobs). Expect to spend some time getting this adjusted.",1

So I started putting her in the stand position so she couldn't ""rock"" it forward and somehow she leaned so far to the side that the entire chair tipped over with her in it and landing right on her head!I would not recommend this chair for infants who are trying to sit up. I will put this chair away for when she's older and as for now I'm stuck buying another chair that won't do this. Very disappointing.",0

We were using it in our Family Room/Office and it had to run all the time on high and still did not keep the room warm. I had to wrap up in a blanket to try to keep warm. This year our heating cost has gone out of sight due to the EdenPURE. This product is overpriced and not efficient. We just received a Lasko Tower Heater, Model #5775 from Amazon yesterday and could immediately see the difference in the heating power of this unit.

I got the 5050 about 2 months after it was released and I couldn't be happier. The image quality blows away anything in its category, including the coolpix. Getting familiar with the RAW mode is highly recommended as it will give you smaller images than the tiff format (and in much better quality), eliminates all noise, and gives you a greater range of controls over the image once it is taken.The controls are exhausting, and took a bit of time to get used to, but now it's like second nature.The flash is a little too bright and requires some compensation for a decent image.In conjunction with a middle-of-the-road photo printer, I'm able to produce images superior to any point-and-shoot 35mm and that rivals my SLR.",1
1905,"Thought provoking and readable: Markson discards the narrative form and focuses on what's interesting, the tidbits and anecdotes. The message of the novel is what he focuses on, the deaths, the misfortunes, the tabloid-like stories of the literary and philosophical giants. While throughly readable and engaging, I didn't find this work to be revealing or insightful in the way would stand up to some of their great ones. Perhaps I'm missing his allusions, but the insight of an anecdote is in its application, and in the stripped form of this novel many of those allusions read as if from a book of quotations.",1

1907,"You could ""Roll One"" on the Surface of this Thing: It may be good enough for a pot-head to roll a joint on(especially if the boss is paying for it). I went through two of them in a month's time. A dopehead will hang out in the shop for days and milk you dry before he tells you that it broke down, or that he cannot change the blades on the aluminum head once they have worn down a bit. The bolts won't come out of the aluminum drum in order for you to change the blades.Of course, it worked just long enough for me to put a little faith in it, as Delta rests on it's laurels and it's ""American-Made"" name of old. But of course, it's made in China now.Don't buy this thing, and don't hire any ""American-Made"" dope-heads. The combination would drain your checkbook in a very short time.-A Professional Woodworker since 1985P.S. Not trying to win a popularity contest with dopeheads.",0

1909,"Faithful? Ha!: The only people who would think this was faithful to the book, haven't read it. I guess it's just so dull people assume the book must be like that or they wouldn't make the movie. The scene where a bunch of stuffed animals start to quiver to life is hilarious.",0

1911,cool little book: this book is fun to have around for some random reading and even for quizzing others on their random knowledge of the lists...good coffee table book :o),1
1912,"For fans of 'A Wild Sheep Chase' and 'Dance, Dance, Dance': It's shorter than I expected, (the book itself is about 5 x 3 inches, so good for a pocket, I suppose), but it's good Murakami. Offers some back-story on characters from Sheep Chase and Dance, and while nothing really mystical or surprising happens it's interesting to read through earlier work by the author. It struck me that his protagonist, who is the same as in Sheep Chase and Dance, is, like the author, much younger and with very different priorities than in the later works. He also has a different outlook, seems more human and vulnerable (not quite as Sam Spade as the author's later characters) which again gives the reader an interesting glimpse of the author as a younger, less experienced author. The translation's not as great as his newer stuff, which I've read he translates himself, but hey, it's ""new-to-me"" Murakami, so who the hell's complaining?",1

1914,"Not worth saving a few bucks and buying from unknown seller: Pleasures Exotic by Estee Lauder for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum SprayThe one i received from the seller seems to be fake. It has a yellowish color and the scent seem off and doesn't last long. I just ordered this online because i have a gift card to use and the one i currently have is about to run out. I haven't use it then and guess returning it back is an issue because you have to pay restocking fee. If i just bought it from Macy's, there wont be a problem returning it back. I would like to get my money back and return the merchandise.",0
1915,"Excellent coverage of wide-range of Web topics: I found this book to be an excellent work on Internet programming. Although I am an experienced programmer, I'm fairly new to a lot of Web concepts. This book fills in the gap very nicely! I don't think you can say this book is for ""beginners"" or ""advanced users""--I think there is something there for everybody.Two topics I found particulary clear & useful dealt with security and Web databases. There is also a lot of useful material on HTML, Java, and CGI gateways. There is also in-depth coverage of material for Web administration which is probably pretty good too, but since I'm not involved with that, I can't say for sure. But I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in Web development, especially programmer-types.",1
1916,"a rippoff: this is another cover that that was worthless specially for 40.00 same as the other one I got, it started to get a big rip on the same day as we were trying to get the antena out, so this was another ripoff, I got one at wallmart that I'm still using",0

Superb fight scenes.On the eve of the Chong Yong Festival, golden flowers fill the Imperial palace, when the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) unexpectly returns his arrival uncovers illicit love affair by the Empress Liang (Gong Li), dangerous alliances, conspiracies; all of which threaten to overthrow his power. However, it may well be the Emperors own dark secret that threatens most.One very dysfunctional family, everyone bar the Emperor ends up dead.",1
1920,"Started flaking soon after purchase: A couple months after I purchased this belt, the leather started flaking off the front. It's not so bad because it's covered by the overlap of the belt. Probably would have chose a higher quality belt if I had known that would be the case.",0
1921,Returned for refund: I returned the Gen 5 Station as it was no use to me because I had returned the Archos 705. I gave it 5 stars as it did what it was supposed to do. The problem I had was with the 705.,1
1922,"Toothless: In the story Junie B built a bastion;; she's not going to let her tooth came out, but Grandpa had other plans. In other words, Grandpa uses his amity relationship with Junie B to play a trick on her tooth. Also, parents who want their children to believe in the tooth fairy may be fomented to hyperventilate when Junie B says that the tooth fairy is fake. Clearly, this may be an awkward moment. Parents have to decide if they value the story enough to continue reading the book. Yet, the story will remind parents about a halcyon-they will remember when they couldn't wait for the tooth fairy to leave them a trinket.",1
1923,"An Interesting Journalistic Account: This book is an interesting journalistic account of Middle crises over the past three decades. I did take time to cross verify some of the incidents narrated in the book with the Indians who were working in Kuwait during Iraqi invasion and their independent versions were in agreement with this book's account. Though it can be argued that Fisk has failed to see things from the vantage point of Israel and Western powers, it cannot be denied that his first hand accounts of combat zones are unbiased and elegantly articulated.",1
1924,"more right-wing propaganda without facts: A book of ""quotes"" out of context. Read Hillary's ""Living History"" to find out why she is a Yankees fan. And a Cubs fan. Yes, it's possible to be fans of both teams. As for being named after a famous mountaineer, I don't claim to know the facts, but Sir Edmund Hillary was born in 1919 and was climbing mountains years before Hillary was born.",0
1925,"Love Dexter: I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played, I think he is great!!!",1

Then her mysterious bodyguard made a shocking proposal: ""Marry me."" She'd thought Farid Nasir more machine than a man - now Samira yearned to uncover the hidden depths of the man she would call husband...For Farid, marrying the princess to save his country's honor was all in a day's work - until nighttime came.

1927,"Sad: Like a lot of Motley fans, I was excited when they got Vince back and was really looking forward to this album. Finally! Real rock n' roll again instead of all the post-grunge Nirvana wannabe bands. But, the Crue failed to bring fun heavy metal back to life. This album is awful...and the good times 80s bads apparently are all sadly headed to a slow, painful extinction. The reunited Crue was the last chance to bring back the old days and they put out this terrible album. Too bad.",0
1928,"Doesn't taste like H&S Midsummer's Peach: I was very excited to be able to get the Midsummer's Peach because it's been unavailable from Harney & Sons for a while now. I drank it so much that I used to buy it in bulk directly from them. When this tea arrived I quickly brewed up a cup and couldn't believe it was the same tea! The flavor was overwhelming, jarring, not subtle. Maybe this is the last stash that has aged poorly. Anyway, if you like Harney & Sons' Midsummer's Peach this won't be your nostalgia tea.",0
1929,Fascinating: Very interesting perspective on the American economy and how it shaped our politics and country. This book also illustrates how the more things change the more they stay the same.,1
1930,"yuck: I've been forced to watch this film every year for the past five years at school. This movie is probably the stupidest thing to ever grace the Earth. If you are going to teach kids about the civil rights movement than do it right, show them a documentary or a realistic film. This movie is a real joke and the characters suck.",0

A strange combination of people pulled together by some wrongs dealt out to the toy maker and a bookmaker - revenge in this particular case is definitely worth the effort. Great read",1
1933,"For the Greater Good?: I disagree with the central premise of this book, which seems to be that the truth (self-defined though it may be) is always of more value than compassion, justice, or the well-being of others. I am not advancing the greater good by telling my wife she looks fat in that outfit, or telling associates precisly how I feel about them at precisly that time. Why is my perceived need to be ""Radically Honest"" in all things more inportant that my wife's feelings and love? Why is my personal need to feel superior because I tell all-the-truth-all-the-time and you don't more important than maintaining proper social realtionships and, yes, lying simply because it works in society and advances the greater good?",0

1936,"Awful: Ineffective and Broke after Minimal Use: I used this product in my mountain cabin, where it is very dry. After using it about 12 days over a period of 6 months, it developed a loud swirling sound. Then, after 12 months (used it only about 25 times), it malfunctioned and dripped water all over my upstairs, creating a stain the carpet and downstairs ceiling.To make matters worse, it was never able to really keep up with the dryness. Although it was in a small bedroom, the humidity level never rose more than 3 - 5% (e.g., if it started at 20%, it might reach 25% if I was lucky).Put simply, this product does not last and does not work in very dry climates.",0
1937,"Fun times, cute animation: I heard good things about Blue Dragon so I picked it up. I found great graphics, an entertaining storyline, fun characters and enemies, and a great tutorial for learning all the ins and outs of all the combat and equipping etc. (RPG fans will relate when I say that sometimes this aspect of an RPG can become cumbersome) but this game is not. However, my character is pretty leveled up for the current stage of the game (its pretty early on) and I keep getting beaten by a giant bear. I am borderline frustrated with it at this point and have placed it back on a shelf for a second try later. I do reccommend you give this one a try though if you are a fan of RPG's and are looking for something new. I was also surprised to open up the case and find 3 discs inside...should be a fairly engrossing experience once i get past that bear...",1
1938,"great advanced linear algebra book: This is a great linear algebra book for anyone who has already had an undergraduate course in linear algebra. It would help even more if the reader has already had at least one semester of abstract algebra (modern algebra). As for the content of the book, it is very readable and it will go well beyond what you may have learned about linear algebra in the past. The first chapter is on vector spaces whereas in more elementary texts, vector spaces are not treated until later chapters - after learning how to compute the solutions to systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition or other methods. This book is not about computation but about the development of theory. Bottom line: great book for someone looking to get heavy into the theory of linear algebra and to get a deep understanding of modules, linear operators and transformations, Hilbert spaces, metric spaces, etc. Have fun with it!",1
1939,"I had NO interest in politics...until now!: The book was excellent! I was very intrigued by the honesty in the book. He tells it like he sees it. I also gained an utmost respect for the Navy SEALS. I had no idea how grueling it is, they really train hard! I really admire his ideas, and I feel they are really excellent points. Especially the part about family values. Everything starts at home....we ALL need to work on this as a society. Who knows- he may become president one day! It was a hard book to put down once I started reading it!",1
1940,Wonderful: The name interpretations in this book are fascinating; I particularly enjoy the Hebrew translations. This book led me to learn more about the meanings of the Hebrew letters.

However, the flash malfunctioned after less than 6 months.As far as ease of use, overall it is not bad, but subjects are difficult to line up in the viewfinder.Compared to others on the market, it is loaded with features (as long as it works).

It makes you feel like you're in the gym with your own personal trainer. I didn't feel intimidated with the workouts starting out, either; he encourages you to start with what you can handle and work up to the level of the videos. He offers tips to get the best results, and alternative methods until you build your strength up. I love this program, can't wait to see the change.",1

1946,"Not a rap fan....: This is one album I never thought I would buy. Leave aside the fact that most of my favorite music is country or 80's rock, or the fact that I'm not a member of the MTV generation at 26, I'm also a fairly conservative, professional, mother and wife. Not exactly the target audience, I'm sure. However, I have really enjoyed the music on this album. Although ""Without Me"" remains my favorite, there are some very good songs of the CD, in a variety of formats, and the use of language is not only entertaining and 'in your face,' it's downright amazing. The fact that anyone could include ""Munchhausen Syndrome"" in a rap, rhymed and smooth, is impressive in it's own right. Definitely worth listening to, even if you're not into this particular genre.",1
1947,"Minty, but refreshing and a great night's sleep: So, I got a bunch of gift certificates for my birthday, and instead of buying a new bed (and it looks like a comparable mattress to my existing will be around 2K?) I got this mattress topper. My husband has minor back trouble and he said his back felt better after one night on it. I stopped using a pillow after the first few nights, actually. At first I worried it would be too squashy, but we covered it with a mattress pad and it was plush and comfy. Then it seemed overwhelmingly ""minty"". Other reviewers mentioned a ""chemical smell"" and so we aired it out for a few days before putting it on the bed. It was super minty smelling, that's true, but after sleeping on it, you feel sort of minty all over, cool and refreshed. I say, if you have a slumpy bed, this is a fine bandaid fix.",1

1950,"I found this book predictable and frought with errors.: This book reads like a high-school journal. I have to say that after encountering the twelfth typographical error, I began searching for the publisher's address in a frustrated attempt to write back to them, informing them that their proofers were all on vacation when the print files were released. I wound up putting it on the shelf unfinished, and I plan to include it in my next yard sale. The plot was predictable and I found the characters to be shallow. I read a lot of fiction, but I was embarrassed to tell my friends about this one. I don't expect to read any more of this author's work, but I would advise her to find another publisher, one who can actually provide editing services.",0

The embracing of the self centered, shallow and annoying character traits was exhausting. I kept waiting for her to pick up a mirror, say ""Ew"" and then gain at least desire for depth. Reading the acknowledgements made me want to slap those folks for encouraging her and myself for not noticing the ""USA Today"" aka McPaper was the source of the ""Knee-slapping hilarious"" review.

Prior to this I had only found a few of the cuts on the Motown composite so that is all that my kids had heard. ""Up on the housetop.."" definately pops. The ballads are absolutely beautiful.

This book is not structured with any real logical order in teaching someone how to program. It's not even a good book to teach you how to use the ATL wizard for beginners.

Yogurt was rather liquid but still edible, but as the weather got cooler my luck with Salton got worse and worse. I think the temperature is very low so all I get is some weird tasting milky liquid. I tried many times with the same results. I tried again and again and threw away cups of yogurt I use organic whole milk, organic milk powder and Greek yogurt as a starter so as you can imagine after I threw away about $30 worth of liquid yogurt I gave up. Now I have a Salton yogurt maker that is going to Goodwill.",0

But what a total disappointment, a major waste of actors, crew, talent and money.I'll give credit to efforts of Renee, Morgan Freeman, et al. to do what they could to carry out a wretchedly implausible script. Freeman, especially, shines. He is truly a great, simpatico actor, for whose character in this non-epic one can almost feel sympathy.But the rest of it you can put back in the can. Chris Rock, especially, disappoints. He is a brilliant, pushing-the-edge comedian on HBO. But here he's just another street-foulmouthed punk, a la Eddie Murphy at Murphy's trashmouth best (worst), like Murphy another self-inflicted waste of talent.Hollywood hubris, again. How could anyone have thought that the premise and execution of this film were worth investing $ in? Don't waste YOUR money. Leave this one on the shelf in the store.",0
1966,"Can you believe the science when the proofread is so bad?: My comment about this book is possibly regarding an editorial error, however -- when someone wants to debunk science that is so unanimously interpreted as correct (i.e. - global warming is an unfolding reality) -- they should probably get all the mundane facts straight.Example: Pismo Beach, California is not north of San Francisco, California.",0

1970,Basic super hero set: For the price paid I didn't expect to much. The outfits are for kids in the range from 2.5-5. The fabric is pretty flimsy but has help up so far. My son enjoys putting these on and pretending to be a super hero so from that stand point the purchase was a success. They are very basic outfits but fit the bill.,1

1972,"I reread this trilogy every 10 years: The Crystal Singer series is a must read for anyone who loves imagining what the distant future might bring. The author creates fantasy future worlds that are so very believable - I feel I have been to the places she describes.The additional treat is the characterizations - Anne McCaffery is a genius when it comes to creating strong characters with a variety of interesting traits.Put these two things together and you end up with the very best of storytelling. The only complaint I have is that there's not an unending supply of this series!One important note: I highly recommend that you read these books in order.

V was my first exposure to SB and, although I thought it was a bit too derivative of old-school prog I found myself enjoying the music more with repeated listenings.

1976,"Leftist propaganda: Of the three Harry Palmer films this is the absolute worst.What annoys me the most is that the pro-America crowd is depicted as over-the-top Nazis wannabes replete with the fake swastika and the eagle for a symbol, obviously to hint that the anti-communist crowd in America are flat-earth Nazis. The Hollywood Leftists got hold of this franchise just like they did the '24' franchise after season 4.At this point Caine is phoning in his performance.The 'Ipcress File' and 'Funeral In Berlin' are the two films that retain the true Cold War spirit of defeating international communism.This one is to be avoided at all costs...or at least chuckled at for the comic relief. Pure propaganda.For the record I watched this on Netflix streaming. As far as I know the DVD is not available. Good riddance.",0
1977,"Not perfect, but well worth reading.: It's refreshing to read a history book from another point of view. Loewen brings up some interesting facts which you aren't likely to find in a high school text book. For example;""during the entire period from 1953 to 1977, the people in charge of U.S. foreign policy were all on the Rockefeller family payroll.""A very interesting and worthwhile book.",1
1978,"just enough recipes: The recipes in this book are not too difficult nor are they time consuming. I would have liked to see more photos, but then again, most people have an idea of what the dish should look like. The book is not too expensive and makes a good addition to your ""quick and easy"" library of recipes.",1
1979,"Worthless book: I purchased this book for Calc III (Didn't have time to get it from Amazon otherwise I would have purchased just the Calc III book). While trying to do the homework, I return to the text for help. The examples are far and few between and even when you do get one, its very basic. I absolutely do not recommend this book.",0
1980,"I like Toon's!: All right, you get Relinquished, Dark Illusian Ritual, Toon World and veries toon monsters. It's a good deck, for experiancedplayers, that is. So what you lose 1000 LP when you activate toon world and 700 after atoon attacks! Buy this deck!",1
1981,"Unreadable Kindle Font: I think it is a good book, but the quality of the text on the Kindle edition is so bad I can't get through it after several attempts. Looks like a very bad scan. Have tried it on my Kindle, on the PC software, and the iPad app - same results. Changing the size doesn't help either. Very odd - have read dozens of books on Kindle, this is the first one like this where the quality of the transfer got in the way.So I am buying the print version.",0
1982,THIS is what's destroying people's minds?!: You have GOT to be kidding. I slogged through this confused gibberish in an attempt to give it a fair hearing. What an utter waste of time. Hubbard was nuts but clever. It's just hard to believe that educated people get sucked into the Scientology morass.,0
1983,already fallen apart: I was more than happy with the prompt delivery from the seller but the product itself I am not so impressed with. It has already started to fall apart on the bottom chest band elastic. It also was never as comfortable as my other sleep bra.,0
1984,"It's a horrible shame that this is out of print...: ... or it would be another of the books on my permanent gift-giving list.Reading this book is like rummaging through the proverbial attic. It's full of dusty, shabby notions that seem dated, broken, and discredited; what seemed enlightened in 1920 is disturbingly racist now, for example, and the veiled denunciations of Aleister Crowley are valuable only as historical curiosities.But in the dusty clutter, there are occasional treasures of inestimable value. Dion Fortune expressed, possibly better than any writer I've ever encountered, the extent to which mystical experience relies on the tension between the literal and the metaphorical. Buried in the middle of this book is an allegorical passage as deep and expressive as Plato's cave.If you can find this anywhere, it's worth the search.",1
1985,"Awful!: I enjoyed Weston Price's book very much, which simply served to deepen my disappointment in Nourishing Traditions. As a professional head chef with 20 years experience on the line, I defy anyone to actually eat the dishes created from these horrible recipes. Nearly every recipe makes fundamental mistakes that will destroy otherwise good ingredients. They should call it ""Nourishing Transgressions""! Save your money for a cookbook written by someone who knows how to boil water.",0

1990,"Really Fun!!!: This is the first Backyard Baseball game I have played, and I think it is cool!!! The grapics are all 3-D, which makes it really fun. There are some really fun and creative parks you can play in, and you even get to play with some of the most popular MLB players as kids. There is so much you can do on this game. You can even play a 18 or 32 game season and there is a world series at the end of it. You can also create your own players, which is really fun. I think this game is definetly worth the money. And if you think this is just a boy's game, your wrong. Im a girl and this game is cool!!!",1
1991,"BIG MISTAKE: All i can say is that if i could have given this movie zero stars i would have. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Any fans of the tv series should feel the same. I pray that they don't decide to do books 2 and 3. jeez, it hurts just to think about how suckish this movie was.",0

1993,"pat the bunny: I ordered a number of books for my godson who is 6months. I wanted pat the bunny, because of the good reviews on here and because it is a classic. I was NOT HAPPY when I recieved it, but I had opened it (so I couldnt return it) to get a better look because the book and box came very damaged on the sides. When he opened them today it was clearly his least favorite. I felt though that if I bought this book any later it would be very boring, even when he could actually read the words. Thank god I ordered huge board books of baby's first words,colors,and shapes, babys first animals, and baby's first 100 words cause he loves those. So for someone in a similar position, I'd buy this in person, or get a hardcover of it cause it damages fast.",0
1994,Excellent series: I was thrilled to be able to purchase this series because I recently dropped my Direct TV subscription in favor of viewing the Programs I choose over the air.This dramatic police series is well written with excellent performance by talented actors. I know it's a bit strong for regular TV but it's too bad because it should be viewed by everyone. Thank you Amazon for making it possible for me to access this series.,1
1995,WONDERFUL...PERFECT...: I AM A MOTHER OF TWO GIRLS`AN 8 YEAR OLD AND A 2 MONTH OLD. THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL. IT IS ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE. LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND I FEEL COMPLETELY SURE THAT MY DAUGHTER IS SAFE IN IT. ITS EASY TO TRAVEL WITH AND I GET TONS OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT. NOT ONLY IS IT A CRIB BUT A PLAYPEN WHEN THE BABY GETS OLDER.

1996,"Monotonous in a promised variety: I was expecting a collection of children's musics from very different cultures, but they are sung by the same person (with an unnatural operistic voice) and played by the same orchestra.

1997,Broke after one week.: I loved my Rio the first week I had it. Unfortunately the hard drive crashed and I had to send it back. I should have read more of these reviews before purchasing. The manufacturer must have very poor quality control to produce a product this bad.,0
1998,"The End... For a lot of things: I cannot imagine being in the mind of Raul Endymion for an instant. It has been hard not to skim; to train myself to read each of these Simmons novels every page! Such a simple track to begin with, I took a break in reading and reviewing and now I see the the utter chaos Dan Simmons has intended to unleash all along. Brother, this a good one.. a sit up and look back.. a re-read all the books and look carefully at the names, dates and places. I like to be impressed, and this did it, Thanks DS.",1
1999,"Victorian Lit at its Height!: This was a wonderful book. The characters are deep and very well developed. Daniel is a little too good to be true, but Gwendolen is the best female character of the time period. She goes through an amazing metamorphosis from spoiled brat to concerned woman. Daniel marrie Mirah because she is his kind and acceptable for him to marry for the time. Jews did not marry English Christians in the 1800's. As a Historian i would know about it. Read this book and watch the PBS companion series from 2002 , it was great!",1
2000,Terrible: Very disappointed the facts don't check. About the only good thing was that Keith Idema was in jail when this book went to press and he could not get his hands on it.,0
2001,"GREAT BOOK ABOUT DINOSAURS: Dinosaurs Unleashed, Dinosaurs for kids, Dinosaurs of Eden and Dinosaurs by design are best books about dinosaurs. I strongly recommend these 4 books to all Christian parents and teachers. I, as parent and religious teacher can testify that kids really like these books and these books are of great help when you start to teach children about truth of God's Creation and when you confront evolutionist dogmas with evidences for biblical Creation, and extinction of dinosaurs in Global Flood. Great illustrations with Adam, Eve and dinosaurs in Eden and with dinosaurs on the Noah's ark. I hope to see more books of this sort.",1
2002,"Very enjoyable book...could have been scarier: I'm a big fan of Mr. Joyce and really enjoy his writing. I enjoyed just about all of Dark Sister, especially the transformation of Maggie, her kids Amy and Sam and Old Liz. Old Liz is one of those classic characters everyone has to love and root for!! My big complaint is Alex, the husband and father. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but felt that a number of his actions were not very belieavable, and also out of character. It was as of Mr. Joyce needed another ""villan"" and ended up going over the top with Alex. But, that's just my opinion. One other note - I'm not sure I'd classify this as a horror book. There weren't any scary parts per se, although dealing with witchcraft and the occult could have opened up more opportunities for a darker story. All in all, Dark Sister was a very quick, very enjoyable read about a number of interesting characters dealing with the subject of witchcraft and how it changes lives.",1

2009,"Guide to the tweens new world: This book is excellent for girls ages 9 - 12 to understand and identify their emotions. The ages targeted by this book are at a developmental point with the capability to identify their feelings. This can be overwhelming to a child, especially when they face significant challenges (parent's divorce, loss of family member or friend, etc.) The Feelings book lets girls know that their emotions are perfectly normal. It also lets girls know that having more than one emotion about about a person or a situation is normal.Guides to various emotions are given. There is also information on how to manage strong emotions and some conflict. Everything is given in an age appropriate way.This is one of American Girls' most popular books, and for good reason. It is a good guide to have when growing up.",1

2011,"A drop in Cussler quality !Not a good book for new Cussler Readers!: Though its book continues the cussler journey with Dirk Pitt at the helm it falls short of expectations established by the previous books. If you have read Cusslers other books i would say you should read it b/c their are huge plot points that occur in this for the series. If you are just looking for something to casually read grab an earlier cussler novel I gaurantee you will find them betterIn this book Dirk Pitt isn't the normal Dirk Pitt, yes he does solve the mystery but he doesn't do it in the regular way, he does have parts where he is the hero but it is not the typical style that I was used to. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't that good",0
2012,"Wish the blumin' ear buds would stay on!: Ok... I am a moderate fan of bose and was excited to see a friend had bought these and on his recommendation, I bought a pair. Then the tide changed:On the day mine arrives, my friend says the ear buds keep falling off. Not good. Oh well, maybe mine will be fine but having looked around on line, there seems to be a lot of buds for sale. Again, not a good sign.When mine arrived, it took me a while to choose the correct bud for my ears. After about 3 weeks, my first ear bud popped off (while my friends' buds now pop off all the time).I nearly lost a bud the other day on a flight. Luckily I found it. A potentially costly and annoying mistake.As for sound, pretty good. Both my friend and I have experienced a few ""popping"" sounds from them.Would I buy them for someone I liked... No. Bose, you need to test these products a little more thoroughly. Naughty naughty.",0

2015,"Best DS9 novel - should have been a TV episode: The only DS9 novel I've read that even compares in greatness to *Fallen Heroes* is the Millenium trilogy; although, the two are very different. They both deal with time travel (one on the best topics in SciFi when done well). *Fallen Heroes* does a good job greating a time travel story in the very near DS9 future. This novel avoid lots of messy time travel paradoxes, and highlights and develops all the DS9 characters individually before they each die via the alien invasion.If it were possible I would rate this novel 8 stars out of 5!!",1

2019,"Decent beginning with worst ending i've ever read: I am not sure if most of the reviews here are from the authors friends but this book wasn't very good. Maybe there is some meaning or some existential stuff at the end but the end was just plain confusing. I don't want to spoil it if you do want to read it based on other reviews but when I read the conclusion I was thinking ""What the !@@#$"". What sucks is it builds up a big mystery and then goes off on the most incredible useless tangent I can think of. Maybe I just don't understand it but if you are looking for something to read that doesn't require a degree in philosophy then I don't recommend this book.",0

2021,"Fine recording of music by this English composer: If you want to become acquainted with the music of John Sheppard, this would be a good recording to start with. If you are already familiar with and enjoy the music of Sheppard and are looking to expand your collection, then this CD will not disappoint you. Christ Church Cathedral Choir, Oxford, is one of England's best traditional choirs of men and boys, and their sound is clear and unified throughout -- an excellent performance. The gentlemen's voices are particularly beautiful, especially in their plainsong passages, and the treble voices are bright and controlled. In addition, the CD liner notes include a very detailed introduction to Sheppard's life and music -- several pages long -- so you can educate yourself about the music you are hearing.",1

I didn't buy the Harlequins because I was a literary snob and didn't want to be seen reading something that looked like a kid's book. However, it's the perfect length for a wait in the Dr's office, sure helping with the stress of sitting around when you have tons of other things you need to be doing. They are not unsophisticated or simplistic ... just a perfect little length. Buying authors on the net has been a great way to broaden my reading. This series was a real winner! It got me hooked on Lori Foster.",1

2026,"Amazing radio. Great value.: I recently purchased the Sangean AM/FM Multi Powered Emergency Radio. It is a very pleasing small size with an amazing amount of volume and clarity. I gave it a couple of cranks, literally, and turned it on and Voila! I was in business. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. This is just what I wanted for an emergency radio source, but I'm already using it around the house because of its small size and wonderful sound. So many small radios have a ""tinny"" quality to their sound...adequate for emergency situations, but nothing I would want to listen to regularly. The Sangean, on the other hand, has a very pleasant tonal quality...quite nice for regular listening. I gave this item five stars without hesitation. Also, it is priced very well. A good buy all around in my opinion.",1

2028,"Initially appealing, but eventually disappointing: Since I was fascinated with the space program as a boy in the mid sixties I was particularly anxious to read the memoirs of a young girl whose family was a participant. The book jacket promised a ""brilliant rendering of an era...of a whole country poised on the edge of...the future of NASA, the outcome of the war and women's lib."" The use of the term ""women's lib"" instead of ""feminism"" should have tipped me off that this would be trivial, trite, and superficial, but I persisted. Finally, on page 160: ""After Gretel left, no one scattered Kotex around the living room or ate all the Dixie cups from the trash can in the bedroom."" That's when I realized that this book is the literary equivalent of Bertha's behavior and moved on to two superb books, Rick Bass' The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness and Castle Freeman Jr's Judgement Hill. Buy them instead of Space.",0
2029,"Trite: When one decides to read a Christian book one can expect religion to be a major player, and so I was not offended at all by the frequent references to Christ. However, I found the book to be extremely trite. Those ""lovable"" characters just seemed contrived and over the top to me. The kid was like a fairy tale, never fussy and always cute with his Malaprop tendencies; just a bit of a stretch to really believe this was a true child. The heroine was a real turn-off. For most of the book she was preachy and opinionated - telling the hero to ""surrender"" to God's will but failing to do just the same until way later in the book. When she did, she immediately became a whole lot more likable! Frankly I forced myself to read until the end just so I could write a review. It's not the Christian aspect that turned me off - on the contrary I've read a few of this sort and really have liked them. But the characters in this book failed to engage my imagination and my empathy.",0

2034,"Battery on collar was a BIG disappointment: I bought this collar Petsafe PUSB-300 new from the store... I don't know how it even passed quality inspection. I was very hesitant to try it out at first due to the one review posted by a user due to its battery problem. I had really no choice but to try this out, since I wanted to stay away from electric shock collars or the citronella spray (too expensive). I bought the colllar for around $50. The collar worked fine for a few hours, then the battery died. I don't see any weather factors that can make the collar malfunction, such as rain, the day I used it on my chihuahua was very sunny and clear. Now I believe the online posters. Please be careful in buying this collar. You may just become disappointed like me and end up buying tons of batteries for it ($10).",0

2037,"Decent advice but couldn't finish book - had to skip around.: This could have been due to my own stupidity and not fully reading the books description. I am a ""twentysomething"" and I have been reading many books about others in their 20s, quarter-life crisis and such. What turned me off about this book, and what may make others really enjoy this book, is the constant religious and god mentions. I am not a christian so I skipped these parts I was able to get over halfway through the book but then had to put it down and move on to the next. I believe only once or twice before I have been unable to finish a book in the past.This does not mean that this book would not be a wonderful choice for others but for me I could not look past the Religious mentions that did not apply to me.",0

2041,"Brilliant Acting. Brilliant Script.: Spiral is the story of Mason (played by Joel Moore), a mentally troubled artist with a love for jazz. During a lunch break, Mason meets and is befriended by a manic depressive Amber (Amber Tamblyn), and the two proceed to draw close to one another during a series of painting sessions. It is here the the story begins to ""spiral"", leading Amber and Mason both a path which has a dark conclusion.The acting in this movie is brilliant, and I do not say that lightly. The script is amazingly constructed, paced perfectly, and drawing you deeply into the lives of the main characters and their attraction for one another. You care about these people, and truly want the best for them. Few movies hold this power over the viewers, but Spiral does it masterfully.Spirit is one of the top 5 movies I have seen this year, and one of the most memorable films I have watched in recent memory. Please take the time to watch this movie and judge for yourself.",1

2047,"Great Motivational Tool: In the past 3 years I have tried MANY pedometers, Omron, Sportline, McDonald's promotional, etc. Omron is the only brand that I have found to be at all accurate. About 3 months ago I read about the newer HJ-112 in Health magazine and knew I had to get one. This pedometer is the most accurate one to date. I love the fact that I can stick it inconspicuously in my pocket or purse and still count my steps. Most others would pop off my waistband at some point and I would lose them. It is amazing how much more aware I am of my daily movement. Every step, and every short walk really adds up. One word of warning: be careful to remember to REMOVE it from your pocket before laundering your pants. I have already sent mine through the washing machine. Fortunately it dried out and still works perfectly, but from now on, I am keeping it inside a sealed Ziploc in my pocket..just in case.",1

2052,"always kept it interesting, no matter who was behind the microphone: You have to hand it to the folks at Rhino Records. They ALWAYS deliver the goods when it comes to greatest hits albums. With The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers you get 33 tracks from the legendary R & B influenced California rockers. The hits just go on and on with tracks ""Listen to the Music,"" ""China Groove,"" ""Takin' It to the Streets,"" ""It Keeps You Runnin',"" ""What a Fool Believes,"" and ""Minute by Minute."" The list goes on and on. There's no doubt these tracks are already burned into you brain from commercials, radio stations, weddings, office parties, and even elevators. Whether laying down guitar heavy hooks or pounding away on the keys with some bluesy soulful music, The Doobie Brothers always kept it interesting, no matter who was behind the microphone.""",1

On the other hand, this is not the place to start, in fact it is rather disappointing, better to get the complete collection and the Christmas special first.",0
2059,"Great Movie! Awesome flick in the star wars universe: This is a really good movie. But it's an ok star wars movie. It's got all the stuff from the first trilogy, but it seems to be missing that special something. Maybe the fact that everything looks like it's an advanced video game took away from some of the story. my eyes got sick staring at some complicated screen of stupid looking creatures and buildings, which is irrelevant to what is actually happening. But this movie is action packed. It reminds me of true lies, where there is action in the beginning, love story in the middle, and it's a thriller at the end. In this movie, their is a Jedi vs Bounty hunter duel, and a car chase. Then their's the whole love thing goin on. finally, at the end their is a huge battle between robots, flying things, and stormtroopers. a great action movie.",1

I was genious of them to give the consumer a 30 money back guarantee because, to my surprise, it broke after 40 days. I have wasted a hundred buck on a machine that did not work anything at all and broke after a month. I might be cheap for somebody like, o I don't know, a doctor or an architect, but I'm a student and 100 bucks is a lot of money. I wanted something compact for my apartment.

I believe that most adults would enjoy it. My mother would enjoy it. And if I were DJ-ing a Christmas party, I'd definitely take it along.Even with the shipping and handling fee, it qualifies as a reasonable Christmas gift costing less than $5.As an Amazon seller, this CD has dropped below my business' threshold for minimum sales price.

Finally, I had to chalk it up to poor quality. If you are looking for a good value, don't purchase this coffee grinder.

This version of Le Orme reminds me more of Traffic instead of ELP.Le Orme are masters at using their instruments and vocals to absolute perfection. Just listen to the second track of this CD, ""Ad Gloriam,"" where Le Orme uses instruments and background vocals to deliver a sweet, relaxing musical piece.This CD is excellent. The music is fantastic and the sound quality is terrific. This CD is a must, even if you do not understand Italian.

And while Culbertson does well to honor the comrades he fought with, I found this book more of a recruiting pitch for the Corps, rather than a historical account. Even more annoying was Culbertson's attempts to revise military history... telling us how the Marine's won WWI for the French, or how Hanoi could have fallen if we'd just sent in an airborne division and a Marine Assault Force.When the author manages to stick to the subject, we get to see Culbertson's ample knowledge of firearms, sniper tactics and the conditions these men fought in. But unfortunately for readers, we have to wade through pages of jingoistic and Christo-righteous tangents to find it.",0

2077,"Probability, Philosophy and History: There are many popular books written on the subject of probability, risk and statistics; I've read many of them. Many such books concentrate on the meaning and practical uses of probability while others concentrate on the misuses and abuses of statistics. This book is different. It is much heavier on philosophy with many entertaining historical excursions. There is little math, but what there is clear and well presented. I found the sections on Bayesian analysis of real world problems particularly fascinating, especially its use in the courtroom. Although, in my opinion, the prose is a bit awkward in a few places, mainly in the first half of the book, this does not detract from the fact that this book is difficult to put down. This work is, I believe, a valuable addition to the popular literature on probability and statistics.",1
2078,"Ultimate in Readability!: I have purchased a few books on wine, only to throw them down in disgust due to the ""high-snobbery"" factor. Alas, Gaiter and Brecher have written a delightful book, full of personal anecdotes, tips, and tastings. There is nothing worse than the myth that the aura of wine need be intimidating to be enjoyed. Brecher and Gaiter share their passion for wine in a way that makes you want to run out and buy wine by the case. It's a book that makes you downright comfortable ordering a glass of wine to go with your grilled cheese sandwich (I'd suggest a riesling.) I wish more authors would put the delight they find in the enjoyment of wine into their writing. If you don't know anything about wine, or if you know everything about wine, you'll be bound to enjoy this book.",1

I am very disappointed with the picture. Besides, the last part of the film was just a duplication from the other Penthouse video, I forgot the title right now, but this part was much better in that DVD, I mean the picture quality.

Everytime you think it's going to rise above melodrama, it just proves that it is in fact just that. On a good note Mandy performs well and there are some nice supporting characters like Halley's mother and pot smoking grandmother. To bad the script is mediocre. It's worth a look, but only worth owning if you must have everything that Moore does.

It set the tone of the for me showing the importance and value of having music in your life. Each page is designated for one letter in the alphabet. A capital letter and lower case letter are shown, as well as a statement relating to music. Adjectives are scattered on the pages describing the instruments, artists or genres discussed. I also love the illustrations. They look like collages printed in bold, rich colors. There are not bright ""happy"" colors in the book though. There are a lot of blues and purples. Overall, I would recommend this book. It is a quality alphabet that exposes children to the world of music.",1

Buckethead makes a couple appearances and the two create some epic jams! Lots of dancing. Lots of nunchucks and karate kicks. There's conversations with monkey's.

2085,"Nemesis: In one of his interviews F.Mercury had deeply regretted of not making a double album instead of making two different ones (A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races he was referring to). Always overshadowed by the A Night, A Day deserves a more respectable place. Interestingly, this record became more popular than the movie from which it borrowed the name (though the Marx Brothers' movie is a classic). In this album they totally give up their ""sugary Led Zepplin"" style, which is originally their starting motive for the band. Perhaps ""You take my breath away"" is too sentimental for an average american ear but ""Somebody to Love"" is irrestible to anyone who likes vocal music. Though I always skip ""Tie Yor Mother Down"" many people find it very appealing. It may be the time to listen their advice. However my pick up would be (Aside from ""Somebody"") the Millionaire Waltz. The waltz-rock is definitely a milestone.",1

I couldn't believe some of the scenes.. all of us girls were like ""we paid to see this? "" and the guys just LOVED it lol I really expected a better storyline.. I know it was a true story, but Spike Lee could of really choose a better point of view of showing the summer of sam murders.. But, some scenes were amazing to watch, because the direction was good.. like when Mira Sorvino and John Lequizamo were in the club dancing.. the lights and choreography was good.. but definately a lot of scenes were not entertaining AT ALL.. lol But there has been mixed reviews about this movie- so rent it if you like.

Obviously, the coffee was hot enough, but coffee in drip makers only heats to a max 160 degrees in the hottest automatic drip maker. The people who complained must have been accustomed to a manual drip, regular percolator or institutional machine.

This volume is overall a good account of the Jewish Community of Rome, though as a previous reviewer stated its title is misleading - there is as much about catacombs, inscriptions and the naming patterns of Romanized Jews as there is about the actual history of the Jewish people in ancient Rome.Despite the large amount of technical content, this is a great source of information on Rome's Jewish communities, and reveals the vital, if overlooked social role they played.",1

2119,"Universal, Beautiful: While many of the stories she tells in her poems are clearly set in specific times and places -- a convent school in India run by Irish nuns; Yuba City, California in the years between 1900 and 1940, for example -- the themes of those stories resonate much beyond those locales.Shining like beacons, the moments of joy or happiness in these poems relieve the otherwise unremitting sadness evoked by the painful lengths of abuse, suicide and death, and fear in so many of the poems. For example, the exhiliration of the 19-20 year old narrator escaping the family home for the big city lights of Las Vegas or Los Angeles, in the eponymous poem, is palpable. And although it's clear that she's not just a teenager escaping any home -- she's a teenager escaping a restrictive traditional home with a possible arranged marriage in her future -- the poem easily evoked the same sense of a caged animal smelling freedom in me, someone who never lived in that kind of household.Beautifully written.",1

The orchestration of the pit is different, using a woodwind player (flute, clarinet, sax) and a violinist. The cast is terrific (even though Lucy can be abrasive.)",1
2121,"Movie-Good Book-Bad: I consider myself to be one of the biggest fans of the jaws movie, and was interested to see how the book differed. This book is very dull and contains the smut of a Paul Verhoven (director of basic instinct) movie. This book is as dull and confusing as a Mia Angelo poem. Do not bother trying to understand this book-it's like wallpaper-YOU CAN'T GET A READ ON IT!!!!",0
2122,"Not as hoped: This lock installed relatively quickly and easily, but doesn't really work. The locking mechanism interferes with the operation of the handle, but if you pull hard enough you can get the tailgate latches to release and open the gate. Plus, after doing that, the pressure on the locking mechanism now makes turning the key VERY difficult. Good thing it didn't cost much and the rear door for my new cap blocks the tailgate from opening or I would be a lot angrier.",0
2123,"Bored very quickly: I initially thought this would be great for my 10-yr old. He is heavily in to Pokemon both cards and Nintendo games. It was too high a price to pay for something that was played so little. He was easily bored after just a few times. At (this price) you really can't go wrong. Some kids may love it. But if your child is looking for the usual ""Pokemon action"" in a game, don't waste your money.",0
2124,"A Classic of Modern Philosophy: Do not get confused. This book seems to be written for children, and no doubt they will enjoy it. But this is, hands down, one of the greatest, most lucid and simple books on post-modern angst I can think of. The message: We always have a fear of a painful and uncertain end, and we do whatever we can to avoid the inevitable. But, in the end, the monster is ourselves. Buy this for your favorite existentialist or buddhist. You will not be disappointed. I even used this book as a source for my Master's Thesis on Absurdist theatre. It warrants praise.",1

A plague will wipe out the old Homo sapiens, and then, well, that's the question, Satan rules supreme, I suppose. The Catholic Church is absolved of the sins of the Inquisition in this alternate reality,since they were just trying to root out the breeding program of the Satanists all those years, and continuing to do so to the present. And where did this arcane breeding knowledge come from? Why, from King Solomon! Strieber apparently wanted to weave in a bit of anti-Semitic blood libel into the tale.Luckily, I got my copy used, and since it is such utter trash, I didn't feel bad throwing into the recycling bin.",0

These books tell about Boba Fett (the bounty hunter) as a young boy, in this book he must escape Count Dooku and the Jedi. I must say I really liked the first book but this one is a very interesting book.The characters in this book are the ones you do not see in the movies.

Beloved my a## . Charles was a wimp, Gareth was more of a beloved who stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for his brother's ""mistake"", being a first born who was set aside as a ""mistake"" I found this book to be a sad testament to how easy it is for men to walk away from responsibility.

2149,"No help.: This book perpetuates the out-dated idea that Fibromyalgia is helped to worsen by your own mentality and emotions. It's funny that Amazon.com paired it with ""What your Doctor may not tell you about Fibromyalgia..."" by Dr. St. Amand; seeing as how their contents completely contradict one another. If you want ""freedom from Fibromyalgia,"" do what I did: buy ""What your Doctor may not tell you..."" and get better with guaifenesin like myself and millions of others. Dr. St. Amand is a doctor who knows that having fibromyalgia is what brings on depression, emotional and cognitive problems... not vice versa.

I recommend this book for any type of audience interested in this area.,1

Muttering, and ""philosophizing"" for pages and pages, forcing the reader to endure his supposedly charming, digressive approach to crimesolving, befrore something--anything!--happens to actually advance the plot.Blatty clearly thinks Kinderman is a genius creation; you begin to suspect that Blatty created this character as a self-portrait, and lets him drone on purely out of narcissism.If you find this book, as I did, in some dusty thrift store, leave it there.",0

It requires several extra steps to transfer all the scanned info and not all the fields that I need in Quicken are available in the scan batch.

It's a nice drive nonetheless, but you're coming up from the west to the tunnel or the east to the tunnel and you're not making over the top from either direction. I don't mean challenging or not recommended, but literally impassible.

It was one of about sixty audiotapes that we took with us on our odyssey. We rarely got radio reception while we lived on the road, so we listened to those sixty tapes repeatedly for two years. Exuma's sounds always carried us to even more exotic places than those through which we were passing. When we settled down, we continued listening to it.

Given that the electronic pistols had batteries and associated noises, I assumed it was for a child. However the belt was enormous -- I would guess it is for an adult with a minimum waist of probably 42"" and was not very adjustable to a smaller size. Since the item was purchased a couple of weeks before Halloween, there was no time to return it and get a replacement. There was a considerable amount of cutting and taping that had to be done in order to get this product to work for an 8-year-old. Also, the pistols in the picture appear to be silver while the actual product was white. As far as we can tell from looking at the movie, Jango Fett's pistols are SILVER, so we don't know why we were sent pistols of a different color.",0

Even my 1997 ""English Patient"" laserdisc has subtitles. The less-than-ideal DVD sound quality makes Kristin Scott-Thomas's telling of the story of Gyges almost unintelligible unless one has heard it before.

I gave up on watching him b/c it was like watching paint dry...lol. When I returned about an hour or 2 later I was amazed on how clean the pool was. Diver Dan moves really slow but picks up all the dirt without disrupting the surrounding areas and thus makes my pool far cleaner than my old creepy crawler style cleaner ever could. Diver Dan does occasionally get hung up in spots on the bottom, but he eventually turns out of it. My old creepy couldn't do that! I love Diver Dan, although we did rename him to Scuba Steve!",1

It stayed too soft so it left a gooey mess on my legs instead of sticking to the paper. New trick: Take a cold water bottle and use that to rub the strip down.

As I read further Vonnegut works, I saw that the same style was emulated in each book and I kept questioning whether it was good or not. Vonnegut is truly nothing like any other writer you may have read; when reading the novel, the story seems whole, yet when you reflect upon it, it changes into merely a shell of a story.

2200,"Perfect!: Incredible film! I don't think anyone should compare John Carpenter's film with Stephen King's book.

2201,"Ineffective product for hardwood floors: I have been very disappointed in the swivel sweeper due to the fact that it kicks up an enormous amount of dust as it vacuums. I need to sweep or vacuum my hardwood floors daily (two dogs, two cats), and if I use the swivel sweeper, I also have to dust the entire house. Even a normal broom generates less dust than this thing. So all in all, it has not saved me any time or inconvenience. It's overpriced as well when you add in the exorbitant shipping charges.",0
2202,"Memphis Bell: It has all the new ""RAT PACK"" from the 90's and 2000. It was good and one of the best WWII movies for airplane battle fights I ever saw.

It is very complete in regard to today's technology. I have recommended it to several of my co-workers. A feel this book is required reading for anyone looking to deploy streaming into their organization. Damien Stolarz seems to be a person that is not just a tech writer but a seasoned engineer that has spend much time in the trenches of Internet video. This book is well worth the money.",1

As more and more scientific evidence shows that dark chocolate is good for you I have been trying to find a bar that is very high in the percent coco bean but also tastes good. I had first bough a 95% bar that did not taste good. This bar has the right combination of taste and % for me and I suspect for others as well.,1

Do not let the title of his work trick you- this analysis of the environment is actually false and puts pollution and the degrading state of our planet on the back burner to technology and economical interests. The ""facts"" that he uses are based on sketchy research done by scientists ""sponsored"" (ie: paid off) by large, polluting companies. This book should be taken with a grain of salt and not used by those who wish to destroy our environment as evidence because in fact it is not an accurate assessment. If there is anything to be skeptical about, it is Mr. Lomborg and the information he presents in his book.",0

2213,"Happy with the fountain: I purchased the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain through Amazon.com due to a significantly cheaper price than at our big chain pet stores. ($15.00 cheaper!) I am very happy with the product - cats drink from it with no problems. Why did I rate it a 4? A lot of what I read about it totes that it's quieter than the other models out there. I didn't feel that was true. Also - the little gate that blocks the motor from the hair & debris that can get into the motor - not that great of a blocker, I'm afraid. I think the ""gate blocker"" on the older model from the same company works better. However, not that looks are the final say - but I really like the look of this newer model.",1

2216,"MUST-HAVE MUSICAL: This show's songs seem to have a cult following and it's easy to see why. The melodies are simply beautiful and/or catchy and the lyrics are often sharp. I think the political element of the show, as far as the CD goes, actually works. Nice and suprising to get some half-way accurate history; this isn't the usual Ellis Island idyll. I like the best of Webber and will tolerate even the worst of Sondheim (but only once in the case of ANYONE CAN WHISTLE), so that may help you decide if my tastes are trustworthy. That said, I can't imagine anyone who likes Broadway not enjoying this show.",1

There are so many neurotic, obsessive men out there who can seem pretty wonderful when you first meet them -- so MANY women have had some of the experiences in this film! I thought it was hysterical.

After listening to this CD I found it to sound too corporate and rather dull and uninspiring. If you like Seal's ""Hits"" you might want to check out SEAL II. That's the only Seal CD I have in my collection, although I used to have SEAL III. I heard that the 2-CD Hits (gold packaging with the acoustic songs) is the one to purchase.",0
2222,"Could've been better, too short: This movie was way too short, only 35 minutes, Its about this guy who's chasing a dragon because the dragon kidnapped his girlfriend. While this is happening there is almost no storyline evolving through out the story. The dubbing was the worst I have ever heard and the animation was stiff. If you're an anime fan, do not get this movie!",0

It is a book that positively pulls you in to the story and puts you right there. Returning Son involves everyone. Those who have been in the military, or those who know someone in the military. Even those who just have an interest in the war in Iraq. The author gives you insite on what is really going on in boot camp and then in Iraq. The hell, frustration and family ties. It's about TODAY. A book like no other.",1
2226,"This movie should be titled MONDO CRAP!: First of all, I would like to say that for a shockumentary, this video sucks. Most of the footage deals not with the bizarre, but with stupid subjects that have no business in a shockumentary. The music is good, yes, but the images are so horrible that it makes the music suck too. If you are interested in a shockumentary, try the french film Des Morts or the classic Faces of Death, and for a film on the bizarre, try Beyond Bizarre, but stay away from this film!",0

2228,perfect upgrade: I bought a bike that was a little too small for me. I had to lean over so much to grasp the handles that my hands went numb and my neck was killing me.I wasn't sure what I needed in order to solve this issue...new bar? adjustable stem? Then I ran across this product. Installation was really only 5 minutes. I had no issues with cable length. Took my bike for a spin and instantly I felt the difference. My arms have the correct bend. My hands aren't numb and my neck is fine. Also because of the angle of my head tube it brought my bars a little closer to me as well. Worth every penny!,1
2229,"Beyond Belief: I would like to know what the writer of this novel has done with the real Gregory Benford. I honestly can't credit that this book was written by the author of the Galactic Center series.This exercise was at best reminiscent of an early Andre Norton - heroine plus furry companion wanders through a jungle and some mild, uninvolving perils.I started skip reading - about 1 paragraph in 4 - at 70 or so pages into the book. I know I didn't miss anything in character or plot development and it let me get to the denouement (such as it was) a lot faster.Amazon insist on a minimum one star rating. This novel was so poor that even that rating is one star too many. Bad book - stay away.",0
2230,"Excellent CD: If you are 35+, and even if you're younger, this CD has some incredible music on it. The music and lyrics, apparently all written by Jack Serra-Lima, convey sentiments that we all can relate to. I especially liked ""Southern Comfortably Numb"" which tells a story about a man who never fulfilled his dreams and drinks to forget. Then there is ""Sandy"". It's about the death of a friend. The lyrics present a wonderfully vivid picture of the feelings of someone who has lost someone close to them. The music keeps the mood. ""Growing Up"" has a Beatles feel to it.",1

When i first started playing i notice that the graphics, looks, and animation are just the same as the other ones. Was hoping for a little difference. But i gotta tell you, read up on this game play before buying. If you're looking for the same feeling of adventure while playing episode 1 & 2, do not buy this. I mean you will see different places but this game is like an animated card game. that's why it's the card revolution. I don't think this game evolved. I think it just adapted to the trends.",0
2241,Good adaptation: In terms of a TV to book rendition that often can create a bland product that has no bearing at all to the TV show it springs from this book does a great job. Its not going to win a prize for literature or anything but it does a fairly good job holding the integrity of the characters together and keeping the reader interested.,1

If you love dogs as much as I do purchase this book.",1
2244,"One of my Favorites: Beautifully acted, this film does a good job of portraying the emotional dynamics of the Nolan family, and is remarkably touching. Peggy Ann Garner is wonderful as Francie; Dorothy McGuire captures the essence of Katie. The only possible flaw is that it is not true to the book, which spans a much greater time period than the movie. But, for what it is, it is an excellent example of American film-making. And the book is even better.",1
2245,"Seriously, buy something else.: I thought this book was boring, wordy, and tired. You can tell that his heart was probably not in writing this book. Did he just do it for the money?

I thought that Lisane was kind of a flaky character, and I thought that her background wasn't as throughly explained as is could have been. It also seemed that the author, I don't know, got tired of writng at the end of the book. It was like she just wanted to end the book and so she just lumped everything together in the last chapter and ended it. Everything happend at once and then it was over. And ever that was left kinda vauge in some points. All in all I found it unentertaining and I wouldn't recommend it.",0
2250,"Numbingly unfunny: About as unfunny a book as I've read recently. Bryson's attempt to force a funny expression into every other sentence makes the experience of reading this akin to spending a few hours with a hack comedian who's trying out his new material on you.

All of his books were ""unputdownable"": you just had to know what happened next. That is, until ""Sacrament"". I didn't even finish it as I couldn't care less about the ridiculous main characters and the even more ludicrous and incoherent storyline. ""Galilee"" starts of promising but lacks everything an 6-700 page book needs to be interesting until the end: characters you give a damn about, a story line that has to have a semblance of coherence, interesting dialogues. As with ""Sacrament"", I stopped reading it halfway through, basically because I just didn't care how it finished.",0
2254,Disappointed: I was utterly surprised and disappointed when I opened the box and found what can only be described as a pamphlet inside.It certainly is NOT worth the $49 price tag. The roughly 60+ sheets (printed on both sides) of paper and the oversized type serve as negative reminders that I paid far too much for this booklet.,0
2255,Not worth reading: This book was boring right from the start. There were a lot of irrelevant pieces of information in the story and it seemed disjointed. The author uses pretty corny dialogue for the characters and just isn't entertaining at all.,0

We use the pan for pasta and most everything else requiring that size pan and it's great, NO Sticking so far.The negative side is it's expensive and has an engineering flaw in the absence of a helper handle.

The new ones are pretty, have large easily visible numbers and change for daylight saving time easily. Unfortunately the clocks have a serious design flaw.The little vent for the alarm speaker is on the bottom of the clocks. With the clocks setting flat on a night stand the sound of the alarm is so weak it can hardly be heard. Really, it is so anemic I had to hold the clock up to my ear to hear it.In fact, I set my clock to go off this morning as a test. The alarm didn't wake me up. One might think the moron who designed these clocks could have guessed that putting the alarm vent in a spot where it is covered up was not a good idea.I saw some complaints about this problem with a weak alarm sound in the reviews, but thought they might be exaggerated. They weren't. This thing is a dud as an alarm clock. You would be better off buying a rooster. At least you could hear the crowing in the morning.",0

Where neo-nazis and the black panthers go to recruit new members. Where interracial and homosexual couples have to fear being attacked. Where campus shootings are bound to happen.A movie about reace relations in college was a great idea and there are good performances from the leads in the film. The movie made some great points about students needing to appreciate the opportunities college brings them and taking responsibility for their own lives. However it also puts the characters at such extremes that it makes a totally unrealistic portrayal of college life. If this is what the writer went through in college than the university should be ashamed.",0
2277,"Just a Disappointment: I love Van Allsburg's books, mainly because I love his illustrations. However, I have two problems with this book. First, the layout was a little strange. It's kind of difficult to read a story to someone when the illustration is on a totally different page from the words. Secondly, while I think it is important for most children's books to teach something and have some sort of message this story felt more like propaganda. I just think the message of saving the Earth could have been delivered in a much better way. I'll let you know when I discover a book that deals with this issue in that ""better way.""",0
2278,"I'd love to listen to it but....: Unfortunately, I'm having problems getting things delivered these days. Amazon keeps intermittently putting a label on my shipments that tells UPS to Hold for Pickup. In addition, the label has all zeroes for the phone number. So they can't even try to call me about it. After 2 tries to order it I gave up. I've had this CD before and loved it, but I gave it to my daughter and am trying to replace it. I've asked Amazon to use regular mail and they've promised to, but they still send via UPS. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing. I sure wish there was another way to get this.",0
2279,"If you are not a HUGE Martin Lawrence fan put this one back.: Fortunately for me, I waited til this total waste of film, and time on my part, was on video before viewing. I am not even a fan of Martin Lawrence. I did like Blue Streak, but only because the charming Luke Wilson was in it. I don't think Lawrence has alot of comedic talent. I have to admit there are a few, very few rare momments of Martin Lawrence that I actually consider funny. And maybe one of them was in this film. Blue Streak was a much better movie and story. I am a fan of some of the older, much more funny comedies that involve men dressing up like women for whatever reason. SOME LIKE IT HOT & TOOTSIE are probably the best of the bunch. Plus, how many times can bathroom humor be funny? It's getting old. This waste of time has maybe two or three funny parts, and the rest is just totally stupid. The ending was totally predictable. I think that Martin Lawrence should maybe hangup his fat suit and go back to t.v.",0

I have made fruit leather on them and tomato leather, too, as well as using them for drying celery. Celery shrivels up so much that any mesh is too large to contain it, so they are a must to use when dehydrating it. They'd also be perfect for small herbs or flowers. They are easy to clean and can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.",1

The events were exciting and drew me into the story. The historical aspect was perhaps the best in my opinion. I hadn't realized what a troubled place pre-Protestant Revolution England was and I truly want to keep reading way past my bedtime. My only problem was the romance. It seemed rather dry to me. I just couldn't feel it, however real it might have been. This was just a minor setback as the book really is very good.",1

I read and reread and printed reviews and pep talked myself...but in the end, around page 299, I found myself putting it back on my shelf. In her introduction, Lessing states that readers shouldn't force themselves to read books they aren't ready for, and if they feel no desire to finish a book, they shouldn't. I'm following her advice and putting the book away.I have to give Lessing credit for the style of writing. The various notebooks offer a compelling way to learn about a character. My problem is that the character is boring, self centered, and unemotional. The plot is unremarkable.",0

2292,"Good survey / interesting suggestions: Anderson reviews a range of thrillers. It's a personal view, and you can debate his definition of ""thriller"". However, if you don't expect a definitive survey, then you should enjoy his views, and find some interesting suggestions for your own reading. My tastes aren't too different from Anderson's, so I was pleased that, for example, he identified Dennis Lehane's ""Mystic River"" as a great novel. I was also interested in the backgound biographical information about the novelists, and the explanations about how the business works (Anderson is a novelist himself).It's fun to see who is missing. I would have included the Barry Eisner Rain novels, and the superb John Harvey and Michael Dibdin among the Brits. The book doesn't include a European / Scandinavian section, which is a shame when writers like Karen Fossum are doing great work.",1
2293,"Re-written after the fact.: I wish I had read the author's introduction to the ""diaries"" before I purchased it. Gerhard Engel admits to re-writing and editing the dairies before publishing them. This makes me question the varacity of the so-called diaries. My hunch is that the Engel diaries were edited to cast his role and actions during the Third Reich and those of his comrades and friendly associates in a good light and cast the blame of the mistakes of World War 2 on others. So as a histrocial document I find this so-called ""dairy"" suspect.",0

If you have the crazy notion that you're going to code an entire system solely in JavaScript, then you probably should opt for a different JavaScript book than this one.However, if you already know how to code, and you are interested in just using JavaScript to do the stuff it's good for (client-side field validation, rollovers, cookies, etc.) then get this book. It's inexpensive and it's got great code examples that anyone with a modicum of coding intelligence can extend and modify to their own application. The same cannot be said for the O'Reilly JavaScript book, which is a lengthy, expensive, and relatively useless text, except as a reference for JS methods and properties.",1

This guy really looks like you need to keep him in an aquarium and feed him. The proportions are arguably not as accurate as perhaps safaris more recent version, but Safari's is just a plastic dinosaur, and this guy breaths. I'm not knocking Schleich's or Safari's (more recent) Spinosaurus, they are good models, and better than this one for kids under eight (better durability).

As a result it misses the mark by a long-shot.Jesus did not make the gospel easy to hear. Perhaps we have neutered the gospel in our attempts to market it and sell it?This is gospel-lite at its best, which is really no gospel.

However, you will need to purchase a larger carrying case, for all of your goodies, becuase the one provided is only big enough for the dvd player.

2342,"Cobb Grill: I was disappointed in this rather expensive grill and returned it. The fact that it was developed in South Africa might mean that maybe it's designed for people without much in the way of a fuel supply. It uses 8-10 charcoal briquets which is not a lot of fire. I tried to cook a couple of 1-1/2-inch-thick swordfish steaks and some vegetables. The veggies kept sliding off the nonstick grilling plate, which was annoying. I tried it with and without the dome (cover). I finally gave up after an hour (including a half hour to let the briquets get hot per the instructions) and took everything into the house and finished it on the stove.

It simply lacks anything to recommend it, except possibly for some 8 to 12 year old children. Most of what the other one star votes have said is true.

I could actually feel for the character. Another review stated it was similiar to the Usual Suspects and Memento. I would agree.,1

The AMAZON.COM price is extremly affordable and SHARP products are just as reliable, if not better, than the leading electronics producers.",1
2354,"CBS TV MOVIES on dvd: this movie was broadcast on CBS tv. I had to watch it, because I love TERRIBLE MOVIES. no real gore, no nudity, very safe to watch but I have to give credit to CBS for actually trying to bring back BAD movies!--the SCI-FI channel is doing it and doing it BAD but BAD can be fun. SBSA has all requirements(blonds, chicks in skimpy wear, no acting, no plot and no point). CBS programming is showing various BUG movies and I have seen them too. check your CBS listings periodically and you may find some PREMIERES? coming up. why is this on dvd?---I have no idea but isn't the cover cool. makes you want to throwdown 10 bucks -- just remember what your getting. ---- also, two other worthless movies that probably will come out too are VAMPIRE BATS and LOCUSTS(both starring LUCY LAWLESS) also CBS movies!! ps, this might be a good double flick with HAMMERHEAD-a true classic to come(read my review on that one too).",0

My wife and I were amazed and pleased to discover through reading this book that so much of the details and the leg work of planning our honeymoon could be done online. We found out how to connect with other newlyweds and travelers through a message board that the author recommended, and got the inside scoop on everything from restaurants, nightclubs, romantic/secluded spots in our destination, as well as currency exchange info. and travel safety tips. The best thing about the book, though, was the author's offbeat sense of humor and keen eye for topnotch websites. A must read for any do-it-yourself travel planner.",1
2360,"Great Geography/Culture Resource: With its stunning photography and colorful layout, this book is sure to capture your child's imagination. Far from being a boring book of facts, it teaches about distant lands from the child's perspective. Included are native games, foods, religion, typical school subjects, & more. Unfortunately, like most books of this nature, the book has an obvious P.C. slant. There are large sections dedicated to how humans are destroying the world. Careful planning was also utilized to ensure that every ethnic background was given equal footing, regardless of their actual contribution to society. With a little editing and explanation, this can be a wonderful tool for sparking the interest in your children for other cultures.",1

That's a tough act to pull off without dipping into dreckiness. The Chicks don't disappoint. However ... and please don't flame me on this ... I strongly prefer their earlier CDs musically and instrumentally. Why? I miss the bluegrass and acoustic elements. While they're here as salt and pepper in the mix, Rick Rubin's production leans every track into 70s-era FM-ready country-rock in the Eagles/Asylum Records/Jackson Browne/et al mold. Yes ... the 70s Asylum catalog is a priceless section of my music collection. But that doesn't mean I want THAT sound with TODAY'S Dixie Chicks CDs. So ... four stars, not five.

If fundamentalists would spend MORE time helping out fellow mankind than attributing serendipitous coincidences of daily life to some mystical ""God"" intervention, the world would be a better place to live. Save your money---go put your religion to work and volunteer to help feed the homeless or a family in need and give them the money you'd have spent on this book. Sheesh!

2366,"Couldn't do it: Okay so I think if a certain routine on a DVD requires the person buying it to have a specific item (let's say hand weights or a floor mat), that would be clearly advertised, right? Nope. I bought this because I always loved Paula Abdul's dance routines from the 80's and thought it would be fun. I put the DVD in only to be told I had to do the workouts on a hard floor. Um wow, could you not have mentioned that somewhere in the description? I have carpet in my den which is the only room with a TV that I can work out in. The moves don't work on carpet and you also need more room to move around (something else that's not mentioned) than what I had. Since I didn't actually get through this workout, I can't rate it on that per se, but I was disappointed that I wasted money for something I can't even do.",0

2382,"Without a doubt the best Bond film with Roger Moore: I have always been a big fan of Both Connery and Moore. That being said I think that this is the one film in which you can make the argument that Moore is a better Bond than Connery. He seems to really own the role in this film. He is no longer looking over his shoulder to Connery. It has everything that a fan could ever want in a film. It has some of the best sets, action, and scenery of the series. Not to mention the character of Jaws. Watch the film and I think you will agree.",1

His fascinating stories revolve around horse racing and another subject- always educating the reader on the subject of that particular book. Usually I describe his stories as riveting and intoxicating. I'd rather be reading one of his books than doing anything else! I'm afraid this book was the complete opposite of his others. I had to force myself to finish and at the end had to re-check the cover to make sure this was indeed a Dick Francis novel. I'm not giving up...I'm sure his next book won't be a flop!(If you haven't read The Danger, To the Hilt, or Hot Money...all are superb.)",0

2385,Mediocre and uninspired...: After experiencing this DVD my opinion of the composer Rued Langgaard has not changed. There is a reason why he was revising this piece after so many rejections... It is so mediocre and uninspired that this performance while dedicated and sincere comes off as pompous and trite. The stage direction is just absurd at times bordering on comedy. All the other reviews gushing about how important his music is are just dead wrong. There is a reason his music is seldom performed outside Denmark. It's second rate and badly written. A great disappointment! Buyer Beware!,0

This camera, in auto mode, captures the colors perfectly.It is a little hard to figure out at first and as someone else noted, the manual is worthless. But if you don't mind poking around a bit, you'll soon get the hang of it.

I've been a Strung out fan since the beginning and I must say this is their worst release to date.(and that's including their first album!!!!!!)These guys need to stop listening to bands like Poison the well and Papa Roach and try going back to their roots.

It has a different tone to the game that young kids need at this age so they don't become little machines driven to always win but a person with a heart who plays with heart -- win or lose.

The references to famous movies and individuals would go over many a child's head. The ""physical"" humor can be enjoyed by both children and adults, but the puns and verbal humor, which are more prevalent, are suited more for older individuals. Most references are specific to the 90's though, which may make the humor more significant to those of us who grew up in the decade, but perhaps a little confusing to people who weren't really aware very much then.The only thing that confuses me is why there are no english subtitles.

I could have purchased a very substantial handheld tool with the money I've invested in Dremel... I can't even figure out where to find replacement batteries to purchase.So, it's a good tool for a while, but be prepared to purchase it again and again, especially if you have multiple mutts :)",0
2421,Mother's Special Blend is a wonderful product!: I highly recommend this product. I am 36 weeks now and I have been using this since month 3 of my pregnancy. I do not have any stretch marks.

2428,"Natural supplements only available by prescription?: Has anybody been paying attention to what the Codex people are trying to do to vitamin and other natural supplement sales? How would you like to buy vitamin C only with a prescription from your doctor? Gotta cold? Flu? Spend the money on a doctor's visit first and then buy only prescription vitamin C. Guess who would get the profits on that one? There are a lot of great natural remedy manufacturers that would disappear forever!As does this author, those natural supplement makers have been trying to help while the drug companies are only helping their pocket book. Good job Kevin Trudeau!",1
2429,"THE Patricia Cornwell?: What more can I add to what others have said? This book has to be one of the worst I have read in a long time. The plot is laughable (particularly the bit about the cat!), the dialog is false and the characters are totally unsympathetic. I love the Kay Scarpetta books, and have real trouble believing this one is by the same author. Are there two Patricia Cornwells? If you want a tip - don't waste either your money or your time on this one (unless you're having trouble getting to sleep at night, that is...)",0

2431,"Poetic but Not Biblically Accurate: After reading Kathleen Norris' book ""A Cloister Walk,"" I eagerly sought out this book but am very disappointed. What's interesting about ""Amazing Grace"" is that she makes a good point of riding the fence about being a Christian. She voices several points that are not Biblical, such as suggesting that all paths lead to God and that one can earn one's way to Heaven. Where is the Grace in that? Also, she rarely mentions Jesus who is at the center of Christian faith. It leaves me wondering if Norris actually believes in any of the things she espouses.",0

2433,"The History of the World as nobody ever told you: 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' tell the reader the history of the world as nobody ever told it before. If you love Fantasy literature you've already read this for sure. If you love 20th century literature, you can't miss this. Tolkien uses his tales to bring an entire planet to life. The best writer, the best plot, the story you can read in infinite different ways... what you get when you read this book ? The best of the best. You can also share it with your family... Let's just say that Isaac Asimov read it 4 times. (I already read it 4 times...maybe I'll beat him :-)",1

2438,"Hot Legs: This book will certainly disappoint if you're hoping to learn something new. The first 15 pages talk about the importance of weight training and cardio/aerobic exercise over and over and over. The workouts are not at all the challenge you would expect if you want ""Hot Legs"". What this book offered was a repeat of the same information you get in all the fitness magazines. Nothing new, creative or challenging. I finished it so quickly I could send it back in tomorrow's mail and I just received it today. What a disappointment. Don't waste your money.",0
2439,"The Nazis didn't do it alone: As a History teacher (ten years) and a retired US Special Forces officer, I was anxious to view this documentary. I came away troubled at the fact that the Germans, a supposed 'enlightened' society could allow such atrocities to be carried out in their name. Of the countless documentaries about the Third Reich, this one is informative and honest in its assesment. Let's not forget that we too had American citizens in concentration camps during that same period.",1

No go -- owing to poor encoding problems and horrible packaging from the producers (resulting in ALL of the discs coming off their spindles and perhaps being the culprit behing tiny surface scratches), only one of the pictures was even viewable. A gigantic waste of money. Go ahead and order if you must, but be prepared for the hassle of sending it right back to Amazon.",0

2449,"Great intermediate workout ;-P: I own several Ellen Barrett led workouts, and this is one of the better ones. She's always chipper and outgoing without being anoying or offputting and she leads very well, with clear instruction so you shouldn't get lost too much.All up, this is about 45 minutes and great to do either after a strenuous workout, or at the end of a hard day. You will definately increase flexibility and balance after doing this even only a couple of times. It does get a little easier with each try. With all the yoga moves, there is also muscle toning too. I love the little stretches between moves. There is nice relaxing instrumental music and overall the workout is relaxing (yet you will feel this for the next day or so).I really enjoy doing this (I'm not a major Yoga fan, but enjoy this one) and have done it even twice in one day for the heck of it. It's great and Ellen is great. She's a terrific instructor who clearly loves doing yoga and teaches well. I highly recommend this one.",1

2452,"THEY RUINED A CLASSIC!!!: My husband has worn these for as long as he can remember. Always a classic perfect fit. Now they changed the ""classic fit"" to ""straight fit"" & they are horrible! They changed the waist to a low rise waist... the waist was also ridiculously too wide... The whole hip area looked baggy & unattractive.... The waist rise is so low that it would be impossible to bend over without exposing your rear (plumbers crack) What a shame... Bought 4 pair... returned 4 pair.

2453,"a classic: One of my elective classes required that we read and analyze this book. Wow, I'm very glad I had the opportunity to read it.",1
2454,"Bizarre, self-indulgent book: The author spends a great deal of time listing the many flaws of his peers (sometimes abstracted into personae such as 'Senior Editor') and then proceeds to outline his crank theory of the elements of fiction. The book is not a total loss-- the ridiculously overblown prose is amusing in its own way. And there are a few useful ideas here and there. Still, given that this is the distilled wisdom of thirty years of experience, there's a certain pathos. The book is almost totally irrelevant.",0
2455,"Caricatures not Characters: I had also heard that this book was great, but I found that the story was weak and the characters one-dimensional. In terms of depth it felt more like a book that was written for pre-teens rather than adults, with a melodramatic and unbelievable story line (although given the tough subject matter it's probably not appropriate for a younger audience either). Can't recommend this one.",0
2456,"Conspiracy theory hysteria: The better the book, the longer my review. This will be a short review. I have two problems with Forrest and Gross' work. First, as is common in conspiracy theory writings, it commits the fallacy of the neglected aspect; it builds its case on very carefully selected evidence that supports the authors' belief. The result is a gross misrepresentation of the true state of affairs (the second problem). Unfortunately, this type of hysteria/urban myth plays to the popular audience who keep the newspaper tabloids in business. If one is truly interested in what intelligent design scientists actually propose, one will be much better off reading what they actually say. In my opinion, William Dembski's No Free Lunch would be a good start.",0
2457,"Worth every penny!: This is the greatest radio ever made. I've had mine for over 7 years and have only replaced the batteries ONCE, even after hours of use every day. I've tried several shower radios in the past and they are all cheap crap that I've replaced within a few weeks of use. We have used this radio everywhere (beach, hot tub, shower) and it's been dropped, submerged in water, had sand in it, and generally had the crap beaten out of it... It still works and looks like I just took it out of the box! Not only is it sturdy but the sound quality is EXCELLENT and the digital controls are super easy to use. I highly recommend this for anyone that wants a small radio to take with them in places a normal radio shouldn't be.",1

2460,"A Spiritual Quest Guidebook: For those of us who value spirituality but do not connect well with institutionalized religion, this book offers guidance regarding how to connect with our spirituality by journeying inward. The author, a psychotherapist, offers many fascinating examples of what his clients have encountered when using this method. I especially like the philosolphy underlying the method, which maintains the outlook that there are many pathways to encountering the Divine. The message throughout is that Love lifts us up, transcending doctrine and dogma.",1

2462,"Awful: I cannot believe how bad this CD is. He turned a Fleetwood Mac song of his (""Silver Heels"") into something sick and perverse.

Unfortunately, house finches (who have their own feeder) seem to prefer the thistle seed and are quite capable of standing on a perch and stretching up to the the feeder hole above it. Each finch that does this essentially takes away TWO feeding stations from the goldfinches - the hole above the perch and the one below - so two house finches take up four stations, leaving only two available for the smaller and more timid goldfinches. And yes, there is a small platform under the feeder, just big enough for an ambitious house finch to brace against while it holds on to the metal frame above. This feeder empties out in just one day ....... and the goldfinches get very little of it.",0

2467,"Disappointing: After reading such glowing reviews, I was very disappointed when finishing this novel. Overwritten, implausible and far too beholden to Proust (a model the author freely acknowledges) I found it's only achievement was Makine's attempt to describe being an outsider in two worlds and a member of none. He strives far too hard for literary effect and the effort shows (why use one appropriate adjective when ten will do?). It seems clear to me the critics who reviewed this book were starved for any gesture toward writing serious literature and this resulted in overpraising a modest effort (for another example, see ""Cold Mountain""). The novel was hated almost unanimously by my reading group.",0

I have watched an untold amount of horrible horror movies in my day, and this one has brought me to tears (the good king) unlike any other. From Lassie's mom as a witch with an inexplicable talking plant, to Sonny Bono's classic demise, to the operatic interlude, this movie is unbelievable. You must watch this movie!The only reason I'm not giving this movie five stars is because the sequel isn't fantastic, probably three stars, though it does have its moments.",1
2471,Jump-o-lene: This is a really fun toy but you need a large space for it. My children are very active and one is a bit destructive and would stick the toy with different objects so now it has several holes and will deflate within a couple of hours of inflating.

2473,"A Poor Excuse for a Book: I have just finished this book and doubt I will ever buy another Ann Rule book.

I think authors who are only out there to make $$$$ should give it up.

Having said that, the pillow themselves turn brown pretty fast so you have to add water or rinse them about twice a week. It's kinda a hassle because with the baby, rewatering the pillows is the last thing on your mind. I use these in my other brand wipes warmer, which is not anti-microbial, and I don't have to rewater the pillow for 2 weeks. The conclusion is the Anti-Microbial warmer runs at a hotter temp so the pillows dry up faster.",1

I don't think the author has ever met someone who was a size 16, and if you don't weigh 115 pounds and fit into a size 4, this character will ruin the book for you!

2500,"The child...: I have to agree with the reviewer, Foxtop, this writer is so distracting with her eccentricities and idiosyncracies that I found this book barely tolerable. In fact, after author calls her daughter ""the child Iseault"" one time too many for me (and this was after only about 20 pages), I actually wrote in the margin how grating on my nerves this was.

2504,"Totally Awesome Mayhem: This is the best Zombie show ever. Even my girlfriend, who never watches sci fi or horror (she's a psychiatrist for gods sakes) loves it. I think because of the character development ... you know women. But it makes a sort of sense because if you can suspend your disbelief enough to accept the Zombie Apocalypse, they do a great job depicting how people might actually react and cope in such a situation. Plus there's lots of zombies and action and all that good stuff for us guys who don't really care about feelings but just want some blood and guts. We're totally hooked and were royally p***ed that we have to wait for the second half of season 3 to come out. You should watch this, but start with season 1&2 which you can get on Neflix streaming.",1
2505,"Don't buy this if you own a MAC: After 9 hours of trying to get this ""plug and play"" printer to work with my MAC G4, System 9.1, gave up. The minimal instructions for hook up that were included with the printer are simply wrong. Go to the HP web site, and you'll find pages of instructions on how to get this to work with a MAC, many of which are contradictory. Could get it to print an occasional page, but then it spit out pages with code until it had to be unplugged to stop. Returned it today.",0
2506,Lasts only 15 months: I have had to replace every 15 months. Quality is awful. Toothbrush is effective but uses batteries once a week. This is after a 7 time usage. Does anyone know of a similar product that is made to last.,0
2507,"For God Sakes Turn Around: If you think you're getting quality here, think again baby! Don't over analyze this, it just plain sucks and makes you appreciate Rob more and more. Tribute? Hardly, just a bunch of guys with some extra money trying to ca$h in on MB20's name and music. If you're thinking of purchasing this ""For God Sake's Turn Around"". If anyone wrote a favorable review of this crap they either work for the distributor or are one of the musicians.",0
2508,"Found this at the Library: I went to reserve this from the local library and found that I could get it now in largeprint. I was so confused. I read the cover and saw that the description closely matched what I'm reading here. If it weren't for the largeprint book being available, I would never have realized this is a reprint of a previous published book. That's shameful for so many reasons.",0

2511,"Just ordinary. Aimed at the amateur: I guess this DVD would be okay if you just bought your first digital camera or didn't understand the basics of photography, but it sure doesn't help at all with the advanced features of this camera.Throughout this DVD the instructor refers to ""Part Two"" where all the advanced features will be explained. Trouble is there is no ""Part Two"". I emailed the company twice trying to determine when ""Part Two"" would be available but they never responded. Great cutomer service, huh?I'm sorry I bought it. $25 down the drain.",0
2512,"Great LOUD player!: I ride motorcycle, and needed an MP3 player that is loud enough to drive my in-helmet speakers (cheap $25 ones). I tried a few others including a Samsung and an Archos, neither worked out. I even tried a volume ""booster"" from Radio Shack. No good.I saw this little gadget and ordered it. It's great! Pleny loud (once I adjusted the equalizer..which is a great feature). I use velcro to slap it on my handle bars and the joystick control is perfect for riding.The battery never seems to die either. The quality is great and I'd certainly advise anyone to grab one.Enjoy.",1
2513,Great Movie: Greatest and most inspirational movie Ive ever seen. Definitely one of those feel-good movies you can watch over and over and never get sick of. The message only becomes more meaningful the more you watch it.,1

2517,"I love this game: I was at a friends house and we wanted to play a boardgame. We were actually looking for Risk (another great game by the way), when we stumbled upon this game unopened in his closet. Apparently he'd gotten it as a present and never tried it. So we decided to try it as a joke, as we had done before with Harry Potter's Quidditch board game, which was terrible. After a few trial rounds we realized...hey! This game is really fun!Now I'm addicted. Sure it's not really that much like eBay bidding. Sure some of it is chance. But it's such a great game of reflexes and good bidding skills. If you need a good 3-4 player game, this is definately worth your money.",1
2518,"Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.",1
2519,too expensive: the content of the book is same as international edition which is avaible on ebay why pay this much instead of 55 dolar.,0
2520,"Reads Like a Doctoral Thesis: A fascinating and socially important case, but yikes, this is a dry and wordy book! Amazingly, the author never tells us what happened to the ""heroine"" after the trial--did she die? When? How? Is she still alive, and some 160 years old? Get it out of the library and skim it if you're interested in French political history, but this is not a book you can buy to read over and over.",0
2521,"50 year old book shows it!: If this book was any lamer, it would need crutches. Keep your fingers crossed (get it) that you do not recognize 90% of these ""fine art"" gestures as the same ones you see in the artless US of A. I give this book one star which is still an over rating since there is no half star.If you are still considering this book, point the index fingerout and the thumb up and put it at your temple -- pull the trigger (page 64).",0
2522,"Nurstoons: I was very disappointed in this collection of cartoons. With all the positive humor happening on a daily basis in nursing today, I found this collection to be very negative and at times offensive. I would not recommend it to anyone.",0
2523,"Good advise on tracking and dating: This beautifully designed; well illustrated book provides good advice for researching unidentified family photographs from Daguerreotypes to more recent times. The advice includes how to place the people in your family history and the case studies with their photographs including with each chapter are particularly valuable in that process. I primarily bought the book for tips on dating photographs and Taylor provides good background material, and links to more detailed information. There are some useful common sense tips such as looking at included flags, presidential photos, or whether power lines are included. I would have liked more here, for example when looking at fashions there are just 5 pages for both men and women from 1840-1900 (the only period covered). One deficiency was just one paragraph mentioning real photo postcards .. where the paper they are printed on can included valuable identifying marks to date within a few years.",1
2524,"Great DVD discs: I use these discs to record television shows and movies on my DVD player and they work great. The blank discs can be formatted easily and the DVD discs allow playing it on another DVD player. I could just erase it and use it again for re-recording, and the quality of the re-recordings is good. The Video quality for the four hour time frame I generally use is also great. The product is priced reasonably, and I highly recommend the product.1.Sony 10DPW47R2 4X 4.7 GB DVD+RW Discs (10-Pack)",1
2525,"We all make mistakes: Well i am onee of those people that bought this cd the day it came out hoping for somehting decent but i got terrible. See the probelm with this band is how much they changed there music from past relases. But for the many of you who really dont kno this band used ot be DEATH METAL,\take a deep breath yes death metal, but why the change in there music. Well the record company paid them loads of money to make pop=punk and of course the band did it. The band dosn't even like the music they play anymore and they only do it for the money get it threw your head you poser kids, get any real punk i dont kno maybe Sex Pistols, and possible some clash. But no a a band as horrible as Good Charlotte can do this, to all you kids who think you know everything about good charlotte well guess what your really wrong, get real music not this garbage.",0
2526,Detention camps for German nationals: Mostly this is part of history that we haven't seen in the books:where German nationals ( like the Japanese in California) were rounded up and warehoused for the duration of the war.The drama starts when a German music teacher who is an expatriot and his wife are taken away and his wife dies of an heart attack.The murder of a German woman who is married to a magistrate andhas escaped being sent to the camp is the subject of this episode.The acting and script writing are very good hereand the look at WWII Britain is nice.,1

2530,"Sometimes, size does matter...: I'm with the hubby on a previous review. It's advertised as being an 18 oz. mug and it is most definitely NOT. Using a Pyrex measuring cup I found my mug holds 14 oz. A half cup short makes a big difference. Looks-wise it's okay, but it is too small for my purposes. I feel used.",0
2531,"Unbelievable: This book is horrible. Any HooDoo worker worth their salt would laugh at this silly thing. I read all the reviews before going out to the book store myself, and though many were unfavorable I thought I might as well give it a chance. All I had to do was spend about a half hour looking through it at the store, all the while in dismay that this was published. I have to say that I would side with those who said they felt this book was only published to fulfill a contract. I have lived in new orleans for many many years and noone I have ever met, worked with, or had any contact with at all practices HooDoo as related in this complete tragedy of a book.",0
2532,Do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!: I carve over 40 pumpkins for halloween each year. I thought this looked interesting but after only one minute I realized I wasted my money. It is only designed to remove the skin of the pumpkin and it would probably take you an hour to do one pumkin. I have progressed to more productive power tools like a saber saw.,0
2533,Okay reading: I am not so impressed with this book as Ms. McMillian others. The Flip Side of Sin was not like her other books and I was sooooo dissappointed. Rosalyn left quite a few unanswered questions and it was to much talk about Rosemary (Jesus Christ). I am still a great fan of Rosalyn and will continue to purchase her future books but please try not to dissappoint your fan base.,0
2534,"She Is So ""A"" List!!!: Ok, Kathy Griffin is not for EVERYONE. However for those of ""US"" she is for, there is just NO one that will make you laugh harder! Kathy has that special way of telling her stories and her observations are keen and whitty. No one is ""safe"" (including Kathy herself) from her stories and she finds humor in it all. Can't wait for season 2 on dvd. (and you can watch season 3 on bravo Tuesday nights all summer.....Ok kathy...you OWE me Girl!)",1
2535,"Not what I expected !: Well, I am truly disappointed. It was almost all about mushing dogs in Alaska. I wanted it to be about everyday trials and experiences on survival. The good and bad of it all. I enjoy learning how and what are the best ways of doing this for ones self. But, this wasn't anything close to it. There was one man in particular in the movie that showed how he does things on a daily basis, but, didn't show from beginning to end on how he started it all.So, I do not encourage anyone in buying this movie. I, thank goodness, rented it for one time and glad I did just rent it because basically it was pretty boring. But, does have gorgeous scenery.",0

2538,"Don't Get This Phone: Avoid this phone. I had one for a year, then it went dead. Verizon sold me a new battery, but that wasn't the problem. After four trips to the store, they FedEx'd me a ""new"" (refurbished?) phone, which also went dead after a few weeks. They gave me a third one, which also went dead, so they gave me a fourth phone this morning. Always the same problem -- the screen says ""unable to charge"". Verizon can't explain what that means, but it must be more than a problem with the battery or charger, because they keep giving me a new (or refurbished?) phone of this same model. I don't know much about cell phones, other than there must be better ones than this.",0
2539,"Dire.: The author has no grasp of Drow society and her attempt to make a teenage love story out of what should have been an exciting book is a total failure.The main character has no depth at all and the whole story is shallow. I suggest Ms. Cunningham should take some time to learn about the Drow before she writes any more about them.As for the evil Drow turns good theme... Salvatore already used that one past it's peak, this is just plain boring now.",0

2542,"Puuuuuke.: God, what a horrendous film.OK, here's the deal - If you are ""fed up"" with ""ickiness"" in films today (swearing, violence, drugs, sex, realism, decent music) then you're gonna love this film. If you are a fan of Il Divo, Yanni, Robin Williams, or other things that I PERSONALLY consider to be true ""ickiness"" then go ahead and take a chance on this thing.It's a borderline inept, definition of cheeseball, 2-hour schmaltztravaganza without a genuine or compelling moment in the entire running time.I wanted to die when I watched it.

Nice and soft with interesting colors,patterns and sounds. Appear to be well made and a good size for the little ones. Would buy again and give as a gift.",1
2545,"Interesting Read: In my book, ""Astronomical Symbols on Ancient and Medieval Coins"", I devote an entire chapter to the visions of Constantine, the depiction of these visions on Constantinian coinage, and what Constantine actually saw in the heavens. As part of my research, I read numerous books on the life of Constantine, and I found Jones' book, ""Constantine and the Conversion of Europe,"" to be useful.There many items of interest that added to my understanding of the history of his reign, but at times I found this book to be a bit tedious to read compared to some other books about Constantine that I read. Nevertheless, Jones' book is a valuable resource.I recommend this book to all who are interested in Roman history.Marshall Faintich",1
2546,"Old School Action Movie: I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!",1

2551,"This book is amazing: The recipes go any where from simple, to truly gourmet. Some ideas look that they may be very complicated, but are actually quite simple to prepare. The photographs in this book are spectacular, it has pictures of parts of human bodies covered with food, and are quite exotic. The recipes I made are all delicious, and could also be used when you just want to eat a fancy meal.",1
2552,"Just read 90% of these reviews.: The main reason i'm even writing this review is because for some reason I didn't think to look at book reviews before picking up this book.

2554,Classic is only one worth doing.: I got this DVD a little cheaper from Walmart for $10 but I wanted a supplement to go with my strength training and cardio...I just wanted something that would really work my abs...I found that my 30 day shred was much more effective. i even tried this AFTER my 30 day shred workout and only felt a real push on the Classic Abs segment...I really wish they would do more reps of each exercise...the idea is great but to really get a burn you need more reps. I felt like they tried to pack a lot of different exercises in and didn't spend enough time doing each one.Overall I was disappointed. I too was bugged by having to restart the player each segment...but you don't really move around too much so just keep the remote nearby and that solves that problem.I think the individual exercises are great but I'd rather do them on my own so I can do more reps with them.,0

Frye's witless humor keeps you rolling as Bender's sarcasm adds the subtle but great humor that made this show great. It's just too bad that the show was cancelled!!! Shame on Fox for cancelling anything that doesn't shine as bright as the Simpsons.Not living in the US, I never even heard of this show before it was cancelled. And now, I have to wait for the agonizingly slow sales to release the seasons. And, to twist the knife even more, while Christmas shopping the other day, I saw that in Europe, they have already released seasons 3 & 4 on DVD...too bad its in PAL format :(Why the slow release times for the US?",1

2561,"A Well-written Guide for Novice or Pro: Protection and Reversal Magick is a well done book, for both the novice or the experienced. The author's conversational tone (and occasional humor) is much appreciated. I found that even in just the reading of the book, the principles and ideas seemed to help and I like that the meditations or spells, if you prefer, can be done virtually anywhere at any time. Preferably, of course, you would prefer to be alone to concentrate, but in an emergency you gotta do what you gotta do...The information on how to tell whether you are the recipient of a psychic attack is invaluable.I am looking forward to future books by Jason.

However, there are better books out there that are not sterotypical ""Holocaust"" fiction -- even if it is post-Holocaust fiction. For a good,accurate, distrubing,and thought provoking read try Blood From the Sky, Mendelssohn is on the Roof, The Painted Bird, or even Ida Fink's The Journey.

There are also a few side-B DUB versions of some popular titles, such as ""America"" by Cruisin' Gang, which no one ever heard unless you purchased the original 12"".

2564,"Couldn't Even Finish This One: Hate to say I wasted part of a Friday evening reading this book. Cardboard characters, the attempt to deal with huge issues in the space of a paragraph--totally unconvincing. I didn't even care whether or not the murder attempt was successful. My favorite scene was in the hospital when, supposedly devastated by his father-in-law's death, the writer was still able to wonder if his wife had had time to peruse his manuscript for the fourth time. I guess deciding not to ask right at the moment was real sensitive of him! And he was one of the good guys! Don't bother.",0
2565,"Not impressed: This is a pretty dry book. First it helps to know a little French. Secondly, all this book does is throw in a couple hundred names of designers and places. Third, when the author speak of different designs which were created by people there are no images to back it up, so you really can't produce an image in your head of what the author is describing, the images that are in the book are mainly black and white and drawings which really didn't give me a sense of what the designer was trying to portray. As a designer I purchased this book to learn more about the art deco style, characteristics, elements, materials and influence, which is not what I found in this book.",0

Bob LeBow sifts through a very complicated problem and makes it clear for any reader. Very simply, we, the American public, have been victimized by the interests of insurance companies, managed care companies, pharmaceutical corporations and other branches of our health system. He presents the problem and offers a solution. His style of writing is engaging and holds the reader's interest. I highly recommend this book.",1
2572,This imbicile couldn't grow weeds: This book is a bunch of rehashed crap packaged as something unique. I think that Mr Bell's brain must have been replaced with composting pig manure when he wrote it. If your garden is the size of a flower pot and you live in an ideal environment then you only spend 60 minutes a week on the whole thing. But I live in the real world where I spent more than 60 minutes one week alone diagnosing a fungus on my tomato plants. This book doesn't even cover important topics such as that. This book is crap the one thing it is good for is shredded compost.,0

It really detracts from the story itself. I found the female voices that he does to be very patronizing and inappropriate for the character. It was a prolonged agony to try to get through this particular book, but since I kept hoping it would get better - I stuck it out to the bitter end. What a waste of time.",0

2581,"Disappointed also: I think the actors in this movie have talent. The material just didn't work for them. The first thing that irked me was the cut to's. If you know how to complete a movie, you shouldn't have to inform me of what's going on inbetween sceenes. I hate that as much as I hate talking on a music CD. I am paying to see a movie that explains itself. This film does look like it has a decent budget, but the story doesn't work.",0

2584,"A big disappointment: This film shows the dark side of human behavior without restraint and humanity. For mere voyeurism and violence sake, I see no entertainment value or enjoyment watching women getting raped and men displaying the ""might is right"" justification at any costs. How long does capitivity take for some to butcher and mutilate corpses before justifying cannibalism? How long does being confined with a group of strangers make humans more dangerous to each other before we realize maybe surviving was a bad idea? In any case, I found myself wanting these people to die if these people are whats left of the human race. It was a waste of time watching and money renting this film.",0
2585,"Great Music, Bad Film: I wasn't sure how many stars to give for ""Six Gestures."" The music played by Yo-Yo Ma is fabulous, however, I was dissapointed by the way the film was made. The whole film is cut up and put back into sort of an odd arrangement. There is Yo-Yo Ma playing in Times Square, which I thought was pretty cool, but then there is this guy who plays some sort of a ""modern"" Bach. Weird. And the skating - you could hardly see it - kinda blurry. I was hoping they would show how they choregraphed the skating or maybe more interaction between the musician and the skaters (like the third Suite). Overall, ""Six Gestures"" was a dissapointment.",0

2587,"My first Pratchett book...: This was the first Terry Pratchett book I've ever read, and I must say, I was more than presently surprised.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and found myself laughing out loud on at least 5 occasions. I'm passing the book on to a friend at work, and hope he will enjoy it as much as me.Funny how I haven't heard about Pratchett's work before... it reminds me a lot of the similarly British-humoured, but more well-known (at least in the USA) ""Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" books. Yet, I must say that this book was slightly BETTER than even the best of the five ""Hitchiker"" books... and I can see that Pratchett has been much more productive than Douglas Adams was.Well, it looks like I might be becoming a new Terry Pratchett fan... I've already ordered Monstrous Regiment, and will definately be reading others as well.",1
2588,"Not what is pictured: I purchased this item to use for a Siberian Husky puppy and was very disappointed when it arrived. The sides which show a dog resting its head on are barely able to hold up my hand. With only the slightest pressure the sides cave in and fold over which defeats the purpose. The bottom is VERY thin and can be pinched between two fingers. Your pet might as well be laying on the carpet. The ""sherpa"" cover is also extremely thin and not very soft. It is more like a car buffing material. Lastly the item I received was very dirty on the foam bottom so it was probably returned from previous purchaser. If you love or even care for your pet even a little do not buy this so called bed!",0

So far I've used it to chop onions, grate cheese and shred potatoes, all of which took seconds. Very nice to be able to put everything in the dishwasher too. We can't wait to try scalloping potatoes next.Tip, when grating cheese, cut pieces as long as possible. The last end of the piece will never grate, so you don't want to be left with several end pieces that you have to cut yourself.",1

2594,"Fear And Loathing In Saudi Arabia: I am reminded of Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, Erich Maria Remarque, and, for some odd reason, Frank Abagnale, Jr. Crudity, bluster, soul-baring, black humor, technical detail, vivid imagery, honest emotion--this is some great writing. No, I wouldn't give it to a cousin whose 18-year-old has just finished boot camp and been shipped to Iraq. Nor would I give it to my parents or any young relations. In fact, the only people I could recommend this to safely are certain male peers.This ain't no clean cut John Wayne movie. It's not the Ballad Of The Green Berets. But it is written from the heart and gut. It has to be. Think about it. Swofford's comrades are out there. They can call him on it any time they want to.Would you have the guts to write this book?",1

It truely is as terrible as everyone says.I have past programming and Actionscript experience, so it's pretty easy to pick out the errors in the code examples. So, I'm hoping that the author's updated downloadable code will help me feel better about spending money on this book.Currently I'm about 200 pages into the book, other then typos and poor code formatting, the book seems like it might be a good primer to help me get started. If they do a second edition of this book they should definitely take the time to explain what's happening in the code in greater detail. Some of the concepts and examples leave you wishing that there was another paragraph/page or two about what was done.This is my first New Riders book and if this is what I should expect, it will definitely be the last. The editors at New Riders should be ashamed.",0
2600,"I wish there was more country here: Her voice naturally suits country music the most. In pop music, she tends to lose some soul. But if you are going to have songs with diva-tailored choruses, I'd still take Faith over Kelly Clarkson. There is definite overproduction in places. But at least Cry has an interesting mix of styles. Cry is not as assembly-line as the self-titled CD. And it's like a full realization of what she started on Breathe. There are many songs with good lyrics, like ""If You're Gonna Fly Away,"" a song with more honest pleading than sappiness. One other note: in my opinion, the song ""Stronger"" is Faith's best ballad ever.",1
2601,"Great Album Title / Lousy CD: Aerosmith's idea to do a Blue's flavored album was a great one, nice package, catchy Album title, but then the music doesn't deliver. The first four tracks are decent, but after that it just goes downhill. Not enough variety in the style's of songs, and the vocals aren't as bluesy as they could be. I love the title ""Honkin on Bobo"" just not enough of it, ('bobo' the harmonica that is), to make this CD worth picking up.",0

2603,"Confused Rambling Presentation of Christianity: I found this to be a rather confused rambling presentation of Christianity where the author frequently wanders off into areas barely even tangent to his topic (like his strong personal opinions about the war in Iraq) and often engages in massive unwarranted speculation about the things we read in the Bible like his detailed description of how the people close to the Apostle John supposedly must have ""felt"" and reacted when he died (there is no Biblical or historical evidence to substantiate the detailed account he gives of this) or his speculative account of how long Adam spent naming the animals before Eve was created (the Bible is clear that this all happened on the sixth day of creation - no long period of time here). He seems to be pandering to the confused modern thinking so common in Christianity today and in my opinion ends up just adding to the confusion.",0
2604,MUSIC THAT ENERGIZES YOUR MIND: Randy Klein has the ability to play music that is absolutely beautiful. A completely original pianist. The music touches your soul and your mind.

2612,"Fresh but still pop!: Kylie has been around for donkey's years but this is still ony her fourth US domestic release (Kylie (1988), Enjoy Yourself (1989), Fever (2002), and now Body Language (2004). It's a more mid-tempo affair than her previous US releases and even includes some real slow grooves (Chocolate and the ballad Loving Days). The album is totally fresh but still sticks loosly to Kylie's bubblegum pop roots. She even takes on some R&B lite (Red Blooded Woman and Secret (Take You Home). The single Slow is the oddball of the album incorperating rough vocals and a hypnotic beat. It's like the dirty little sister of her 2002 top 10 Can't Get You Out Of My Head. It's an instantly cool collection but it takes a few spins to 'get' how brilliant it really is. Kylie has yet another album to be proud of here.",1
2613,"A Winner for Kids and Adults!!: Definitely a Newbery Honor Book. Great perspective on peer pressure. The book has very short chapters and makes excellent reading for an 8 year old however, I would probably recommend this book for kids over 10 years of age due to the descriptive contents in killing a pigeon. My 8-year old loved every part of the story except I had her skip chapter 28--the chapter that decribes Wringer school. Spinelli's character of Palmer's pigeon,""Nipper"" is so memorable and realistic it's what makes the story so appealing. I'd recommend this book to young adult readers and adults who love children's literature. I loved the story and I give this book a definite 5 stars.",1

The tricks, the style, the gameplay...nothing is nearly as good as NBA Street. To cover up the cheapness of it all, they slap ""omg bling bling"" all over the place with a unimaginative soundtrack. It's all of the same ""I'll play in the N-B-A, do a slam dunk, get rich 'cuz I'm a BALLAH"" lyrics over and over again with an irritating announcer on top.I really wouldn't suggest that you buy this game. Rent it first to see if you like it. Better yet, just buy NBA Street Vol. 2.",0
2616,"Great for getting lost: Other reviews address the poor quality of the writing and textual information in this book. Let me bring up the issue of the next to useless maps that accompany this text. The detail is about the same as those maps the rental car agencies pass out. Forget finding those back roads to the best spots, those roads don't exist on the maps in this book. If you insist on buying this book, also buy some topos and visit local shops so you don't wast time driving down a road to nowhere.",0
2617,"Far from his best effort: I only recently discovered the work of Tom Piccirilli and have been fairly impressed with his writing over all (the Fever Kill--Piccirilli's first full blown crime nowel--is particularly good.)and I was fairly excited about reading A Choir of Ill Children. The only problem is that the book is far too meandering for it's own good. Piccirilli concentrates on creating a creepy, other worldly atmosphere and does so in spades, but he sacrifices plot in order to demonstrate his obvious poetic gifts. If you're a fan of William S. Burroughs and other such surrealist writing, you'll love A Choir of Ill Children. However, if you''re looking for a straight forward Horror novel, you would do better to look elsewhere in Piccirilli's catalog.",0

The main character, Renee is supposed to be a bad girl who is reformed but she lies and steals a car from the leading male (a cop) and lights a jeep on fire all in the first few chapters. I couldn't believe anything could ever develop between them after that. I disliked this book because Renee's character seemed weak; relying on female ""wiles"" to save her from the mess she's in.",0

2622,"Thrilling: It is a very well written novel in which a newspaper story is very well described with all the details. I liked the hero Robert very much, because he is a kind, warm-hearted person. He doesn't need to show everybody how he is and what he can do. But his kindness is the actually reason for all this grief and tragedy in this book. Jenny, a nice girl who believes that her life tragically marred, is also a very good character. The main subject in this novel is death, which is always mentioned in the course of the story. Quite a remarkable thing is the fact that the persons always guess what the other characters do or even think. The owl is the most important symbol in this novel, although it is mentioned very little. But it is a very important, because in the whole story it plays quite an important part. I liked this novel by Patricia Highsmith very much.",1
2623,Disappointed: I had seen parts of this on Direct TV and wanted to see the whole movie. It was beset with wanton killing and brutality and possibly beastiality. The nude scenes were poorly done and could have been eliminated. Ben Daniels is a good actor and he should not have taken this role. I can not recommend this purchase.,0
2624,"Very good except the range is terrible: This phone is almost perfect. It has all the features you might want, is easy to use, priced reasonably.Unfortunantly, it has the smallest range of any cordless phone I've ever tried.

At 75 feet it is unusable.Two caveats: I haven't checked the manual to see if there is a magic incantation that's required to get it to work properly.

Gotta play it a few time to wrap your ears around all the melodies / time-changes / movements. Chris truly shines as a front-man and his distinct choir-voice & vocals on both lead & back-up add the right ""colour"" to this Yes-man's first solo release.While NOT as airy/spacy as Jon Anderson's OLIAS, it is truly an equal in the composition & production dept.Check out some cool You-tube videos of fans playing Squire's stuff on their own Rickenbacker's!",1

2632,"Overlong and unoriginal: Mr. Clancy is getting lazy. This novel comes across as an expensive, overlong, self-indulgent Mack Bolan yarn. The author basically rehashes actual terrorist events, especially the exploits of Carlos the Jackal and the PLO. The German terrorists who conduct the assault in Vienna are virtual carbon copies of actual Red Army Faction members.Another flaw with this story is the near-invincibility of the protaganists. Clancy's commandos are basically bulletproof, which eliminates much of the suspense inherent in such a tale. The only ""good"" guys killed during the book are tertiary characters at best. Clancy's vaunted penchant for realism is sorely lacking here. I recommend Clear and Present Danger for a more accurate portrayal of combat.If you're interested in stories such as these, pick up a copy of ""Blackhawk Down"" instead.",0

I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this seemed like a great scenario. But the writing is horrific. The author can't string a coherent sentence together.

He loves the bath so much more beucase he too can splash, play, and see everything that is going on. I read a few reviews and there was some negativily about the when you pull the kids out of the seat they may get some red marks on the top of thier theighs, and that has happened.

2647,"Whistle Defective After Two Months: Indeed, this kettle is very aesthetically pleasing, so much so that my wife wanted to exchange it for another one. Unfortunately, the whistler started to fail after only two months use. It certainly is not worth a potential fire in one's kitchen to try and keep a tea kettle with a failed whistling capability.",0

2649,HP printer: Was looking for a light duty printer to work with Vista and would fit in a small space. This HP does both. Came with disk for Vista drivers although HP rep said they would have to be downloaded. Set up easily and ready to print. I don't plan to use network capability but this one does it easily. Some confusion when printing envelopes as you get an error message but ignore and it prints fine. Quiet and efficient for limited jobs.

2652,"Not all that glitters...: Yes, the book is heralded by many. Yes, it is still being used in the Linguistics and English departments of many prominent universities today. However, does that necessarily mean it's all that great???It is highly informative and fairly accurate. However, the book is tainted with linguacentric opinions laced here and there that do not help to educate and enlighten students to the inherent equality of all languages and dialects. A pity!I haven't yet found a perfect text, but perhaps Williams' ""Origins of the English Language"" (available from Amazon ISBN 0029344700) is a better choice for both students and teachers. It is also significantly less expensive.",0
2653,"Terrible reception: This camera is terrible. The wireless signal is so weak that it is hard to make out any image on the screen at all. I had this professionally installed, and have taken it back to make sure it was installed properly, but there is still so much interference that I can not use it. Very, very disappointing. For the record, this was replacing an older wireless backup camera that got stolen, so I know it is not a case of anything in the car blocking the signal.",0
2654,"Very Good!: Tamilee is my favorite instructor, and this is a great program to have for those days that you just don't have time to do a full workout. Each workout is ten minutes (one abs, one arms and one total body), but it really feels like you're working your muscles even in the short amount of time. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't have alot of time in their schedules to fit in long workouts.",1
2655,"Good product, but not great.: I have dealt with acne for over 20 years, all types from white heads to cystic acne. This mask has done several things for my skin: -it cleared up the occassional white head that was still popping up, -it really evened out my skin and alot of the redness is gone, and -it has really helped to control the oil on my face. I used to always have to carry powder with me everywhere to control the shine and now I rarely have to even check my make-up. The only thing this mask did not do was clear my cystic acne. In fact I noticed that it was irritating it and making it worse, so I no longer use the mask on my jawline, where I always get the cystic acne and that has helped alot. Even though it did not clear up all my acne, it has helped enough that I will continue to use it several times a week.",1

I am an older, person so I'm usually concerned about being able to understand the directions on new devices. I was able to preset the radio stations; I've also learned to reset the alarm as I frequently change my wake up time. Radio reception is tricky as I live in the center of a large city, however, if I stretch the wire antenna out straight I can get NPR and my local news/weather station which are the two important ones for me.

We both previously complained about what a pain it was to carry our heavy vacuum cleaners up and down the stairs. She saw it advertised on Amazon and couldn't pass it up. As it turned out, the product was just as described. Lightweight and good at picking up dirt. It's especially great on wood floors and tiles. I'm very happy that I spent such a small amount of money on a great product. The only complaint I have is that the power cord is not quite long enough to reach the nearest outlet and go all the way up the stairs at the same time. I recommend this product to any woman who hates sweeper floors and carry a heaving vacuum up and down the stairs.",1
2661,"A CLEAR NICE READING: The Big Moo sets us at the edge of a cliff and says ""you've got two options: jump and do something remarkable or stay seated as time goes by, and envying people who dares to jump. So, what's your choice?""This is a book addressed to everyone, a book that make us think in improving the way we do things, not only professionally, but also in our personal life. Although it is sometimes far from reality and too close to a dreamer's vision of the workplace, it explores and shakes our comfort zone and the limits of it. The Big Moo asks for changes in the approach, in the way we face things in everyday life, and it asks for it shouting!It's an enthusiastic, inspirational and positive reading which message says ""do things according to yourself and your beliefs, and the most important, do them now!"".I surely recommend it!",1
2662,"Very disappointing: It was like wading through a science text book. I love her historical romance, but this had me desperately trying to find some spark with the characters. There is so much background information before we ever even get into the action, so much telling instead of showing, which breaks all the basic rules of novel writing, that I wonder she ever thought that all the details about the heroins roommate and the heroes entire family, sister, brother in law etc, was even remotely important compared to the essential aspect of romance: the hero and heroine are shown to fall in love.",0

2666,harmful to child development: The authors of this book fail to mention that not one professional organization concerned with the welfare of children endorses it.

2670,"Thought-provoking and very readable: A very good book, in most ways. It covers some familiar ground, but generally with a fresh perspective. One limitation is that it really does stick to the goal of answering that tiresome, bone-headed criticism of evolution as being ""just a theory."" Thus, much space is devoted to hammering home the definition of the word ""theory."" But this explanation does range through many interesting examples, and is always readable.Where I part company with the author is in his closing statements, to the effect that most of what there is to be discovered has already been discovered. (I paraphrase, badly.) I believe that Ben-Ari underestimates the quantity of what we do not yet know, as well as the potential impact of numerous breakthroughs that can already be foreseen. Of course, that's all speculation, and Ben-Ari's take is at least stimulating.In short, a quick, entertaining, worthwhile read.",1

If you embrace the philosophies of service learning and making a difference, and it is important to you that your child or classroom of children understand and become civically responsible individuals, then this book is a great tool.

Even though it is a story/picture book, the older children will enjoy it as well.",1

BUT,the ending was stupid! There are several loose ends in the story and when I read the last page I thought there must be more, there HAD to be more, but there wasn't.

2681,"A Literary Abomination: I fail to see how the other reviewers of this book can praise it so effusively without breaking down into school-girl giggles. Cosmopolis is not a novel, it is a form of torture. The dialogue is unrealistic to the point of absurdity, filled with inane observations and non-sequiturs. In fact, the entire book is so rife with irrelevancies that I'd swear a child with ADD wrote it. My three year-old cousin can compose more coherent sentences than the ones which litter the pages of this atrocity. I seriously wonder whether DeLillo actually thought about what to say in his passages, or if he merely rifled through the dictionary and chose words at random. Be forewarned: buying this book supports literary terrorism.",0
2682,"Ignore some of the negative reviews and give this one a try!: I have read a lot of baby books and I think this one IS well layed out and DOES support breastfeeding. Introducing solids at 4 months is NOT a bad thing, but readers and parents need to know that they DON'T have to do what a book tells them to. DO what you want based on YOUR child's development. And the book doesn't suggest switching from breast to formula. It suggests that at about 5 months you can, if you want to, introduce a bottle of breastmilk to a breast feed baby, not formula! The week by week lay out is helpful, but we ALL know that all babies develop differently and that your child is not always going to be a textbook baby! Gosh, people, lighten up!",1
2683,the audiobook is terrible---don't waste your time: The guy who reads this audiobook does the worst voices I have heard in a while. The book is much too long and very tedious. The writing is sophomoric at best. I want the time back that I wasted on this book!,0
2684,"Somewhat disappointing: I am an Anne Rice fan and I enjoy erotic literature and ideas, but I was disappointed with this book. Although there were some genuinely erotic moments, it seemed that the vast majority of the book was devoted to degradation and humiliation. The story showed no restraint (pun intended), but rather seemed to wallow unrelentingly in extremely masochistic themes. For those who do not find pain, torture and rape erotic, there is little to enjoy.",0
2685,"Do not leave out in cold weather with a load on them!: I'm writing this review as a warning to other owners. I would have gave these saw horses a more favorable review, but my pair was destroyed when I left them out in cold weather with about a 300 pounds load. These saw horses worked fine all summer and fall, but after a cold snap in early winter I found them laying on the ground in pieces. I believe one of the lower brackets snap, then the load shifted, and the whole thing came down. I believe the cold weather is the main reason the plastic shattered in so many pieces.Please note that Amazon technical specs claim the sawhorse(one or pair?) can hold 2500 pounds, while Stanley's website claims they can hold 2900 pounds per pair. I would not trust either of these numbers! I'd like to know who did their ratings. They certainly must have been done under ideal conditions.",0

2688,"interesting subject, mediocre presentation: This book consists of a set of lectures delivered at NYU. Although it is apparent that they must have been fascinating speeches, the transmission to the printed word does not remotely do them justice. The most obvious failure is the lack of an index, references, or figures is grating. The problem goes deeper than that as the book is simply not in the style of a written work.There are many superior works on the subject available, some of them by the same authors who contributed the lecture notes (I hesitate to call them ""chapters"").",0
2689,"Fantastic read, let's have a sequel!: I loved this book and read most of it in one sitting. I loved the ""Stand By Me"" characterizations and the blending of Celtic mythology was fantastic! If there is one thing negative I have to say, it was that Mr. Golden should have left the ending open for a sequel. I wasn't quite as happy with the way things turned out when the children grew up and what happened to them, but that's how real life is anyway, isn't it? I still say that there should definitely be a sequel. There is so much more material in the Neverland world of the Tuatha Da Dannen.",1

2699,"Hear the Kids Roar: Of all the books we have for our kids, this is one that is most likely to elicit smiles and sounds from our 14 month-old twins. We have our own sound effects for each page of opposites, and both kids try to imitate us (with our daughter doing a rather frightening ""roar""). Each page features a series of opposites, such as ""Dinosaur roar...dinosaur squeak"". Finally the book ends with the dinosaurs having an excellent lunch. The pictures are colorful and expressive. However, it is the one book with a picture that I find quite disturbing - the meek dinosaur is cringing on its page, with the shadow of a bigger dinosaur clearly baring its teeth, leading to the conclusion the meek dinosaur is about to become lunch, and I find that a little scary. Other than that, I highly recommend the book.",1

2704,"American Bloomsbury Disappointing: I couldn't resist buying American Bloomsbury by Susan Cheever because the subject matter fascinated me. It's about the lives of several renowned American writers in Concord MA in the 1840's, including Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. While the historical facts were indeed fascinating, I found Cheever's writing style to be more like a term paper than what could have been an inspiring and involved account of an amazing intellectual group of individuals who came together and influenced the literary history of our country. Even worse, as I pushed myself through the book, the time line and relationships were presented in a very confusing way, jumping back and forth over the course of a few years. I was glad to read about these incredible writers' lives, but I wish it had been in a more engaging and organized format.",0

No more of the cult status and cashing in on it for Fiedler. The always inebriated Boston audience caused this because they know nothing of music and performance for having put up with him so long. They'd rather sip their champagne and speak of inanities instead of listening to something other than their own voices--such snobs!",0

She seems to want to write a book of all the Buchanan brothers. Very,very disappointing thus far. Murder List was excruciating and when I thought that things couldn't get worse, she comes up with Slow Burn. I'd wish she'd just write Noah Clayborne's book and be done with the whole series. Hopefully, she'd write a great book for Noah Clayborne.",0

The book moves position by position, teaching scales which best fit each position, and includes etudes written by Mr. Scicchitano himself to give the student experience and good practice with each position.

The songs are all played two beats to fast and the attempts to make the instruments ""sing"" like Jo Dee are sad - especially the flat fiddle.""Heads Carolina, Tails California"", ""Your Not in Kansas Anymore"" and ""That's the Way"" are the highlights, ""Burn"" sounds nothing like the original, ""Bring on the Rain"" is worse and everything else is mediocre at best. I pity if Carolyn Dawn Johnson ever heard this version of ""Downtime"" (which she co-wrote).This CD is much more for the fans of hardcore Appalacian mountain bluegrass music, not so much for the Jo Dee Messina fans.

It was a fun read at first but the whole book got old quickly...the format is hard to follow, with lots of buds on black backgrounds but most have no name and I don't like having to read all the text to find out the name. This is a great idea for a book but not a well thought out final product.",0

2724,"False Advertising: I ordered what was described on this webpage, but unfortunately the description neglects to mention the SPF component of this product. I was sent this product, but it actually has titanium dioxide in it for SPF purposes and if you want the Creme without that you need to get the nighttime version. The nano particles of titanium dioxide are not without dangers, so I suggest buying the other version and get a titanium dioxide-free sunscreen (1,2). Or, since this brand does not have an accurate product description, go with a more responsible company. I do not have much time to shop for cremes like this and was a little displeased I had to go through returning this product and finding a replacement when the product description could have been more accurate.I am now using 100% Pure Coffee Cherry Sun Damage Corrective Cream or 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream, AAA Shea Butter's Cocoa-Nut Creme, and Reviva's Ten Percent Glycolic Acid Night Creme.",0

2726,"I can't finish it either: I thought there was something wrong with me. I heard great things about this, and I was overwhelemed by the snippets of reviews in the book. But the writing really isn't good enough...and I just wasn't that interested in Josie's history nor that of her extremely boring, selfish, annoying husband. Not to mention her boring mother. Sorry, I've just had a spate of reading people like Ian McEwan who can really write...a much better command of the language. I see Elinor Lipman is her mentor...another one that's good but not as great as they say. Interesting that one reviewer says that if you like Le Divorce you'll like this...hmmm....couldn't finish that one either.",0

2729,"Great Promise But Didn't Deliver: I purchased this system (with 7 handsets) about 2 years ago. I have a home business and a 2 line system that I could place handsets in office and house areas was a great hope. Handsets would not work in every area of the house. I tried placing the base unit in different areas but our Master BR unit usually would not ring when a call came. That can be important. But the most serious problem is that now the base unit gives me an E2 message and doesn't work. Uniden Support responded after my second email to say that E2 represented an ""internal issue with the unit"". They offered that the only recourse was to send the unit back for warranty work. Of course, they noted that the warranty is only good for 1 year from purchase. I will never take such a gamble with Uniden again. So, anybody out there want a good deal on 7 Uniden handsets?",0
2730,Dehumidifier does: This DeLonghi dehumidifier comes with a built-in pump so you do not have to empty the collected water. It was easy to set up and started decreasing the humidity in my basement immediately. Within a day or two it dropped the humidity from over 70 percent down to the target I set of 50 percent. I have been using it about two months. It runs automatically maintaining the target humidity I set. I am happy with it and would buy the same model again.,1

2735,"LIftmaster carriage: Replacement part for much less than Sears or a local garage door retailer would charge. Sears is around $20, a local garage shop actually asked $45. I always order two now at a time. The installation is very simple, I would estimate 15-20 minutes and definitely doable for anyone with basic mechanical skills.The problem as other reviewers have stated is with the design. The carriage should be made out of brass to extend its service life. In the plastic version I am changing the carriages out every 2-3 years as a preventive maintenance step even before they fail (you should expect them to fail after 3 years under normal use, better to do it before the door comes crashing down).",0

The lights and movement really do seem to mesmerize my little guy. Almost immediately the fish stopped bubbling and moving... not a big deal. But now it makes an incredibly loud chirping sound. It seems to be the motor. Customer service at Fisher Price is good... they always seem willing to replace defective products. However, we have to wait for them to send us a shipping label and then wait until they receive the defective one until they will ship out a new one. I think we'll try a different brand in the meantime...",0

The book has been useful for making me look at things in a new perspective. But really it's a giant ode to marriage that bashes away at anyone who would decide to live together as somehow immature and unprepared for adult life. I'd hoped for practical points and tips, not an assault on my character. I feel dirty for buying this book.",0

Douglas Kenyon, ed.As we explore the new frontiers of human evolution we are rapidly finding out that we need to rethink our past. All of our rigid beliefs, both scientific and religious, need to be redefined in light of recent archaeological discoveries. This is an excellent compilation of the work of some of the key thinkers on some very highly charged issues, such as creationism and Darwinism.

He didn't (of course) but he's obviously stupid enough to have bought her ruse.Jason was boring, Henrietta (Harry) was annoying, and all in all, this is just another disappointing Coulter.",0

2743,"Good Book: I thought this book was pretty good, different but good. It gets kind of far-fetched at times, and drifts away from reality, but, for the most part it is a decent book to read.As usual, the author did not create any unique dialogue, but I've yet to find an author nowadays who can write any kind of half-decent dialogue.But, I would recommend this book to others to read.",1

2745,"Still great: While not as funny as some of the previous seasons, Psych still makes us laugh every time. Shawn and Gus are great together, and the back-and-forth between the characters delivers, even if the plots don't tickle your funnybone.I know some people didn't like it, but the ""Hangover""-themed episode made us laugh till our sides hurt.",1
2746,"Nice, but lacking depth.: Great story line. I was unable to put the book down. I wanted to know more & I was hoping there would be more. But it lacked depth and conversation. I was unable to get to ""know"" the characters and who they were. I thought it was a great description of a relationship and what it's like when it's over. But to be honest I couldn't wait for the book to be over. I guess even Oprah's Book Club can pick a loser.",0

2748,"My 5-year-old's favorite Christmas gift!: My 5-year-old son got this for Christmas and loves it! He's been playing with it for hours and has finished almost all of the cards. He does sometimes need help on the Expert (level 4) cards, but can solve the others all by himself and gets a real kick out of solving the puzzles. I think the age recommendation (6-8) is a little off, seeing how easily my just-turned-5-year-old can do this. I wish there were more cards, but we can set up the board ourselves which makes for endless puzzles. We will probably purchase the regular Rush Hour as well. Anyway, it's a great game, both for me and my son!",1
2749,"Interesting Story: It is a nice short morality tale. The story itself is quite interesting, and adults will enjoy reading it as much as the child. The squiggled eyed characters are hastely drawn, but fit the raggedy theme of the book. The pictures have a nice modeled texture, and are pleasant for children.[It]is a tad pricy for a 10 minute short story. I would have been disappointed if I paid that amount.",1

Add alot of flavor with just a tablespoon or two of flavored wood (included) to a lonely chicken breast, tuna, mahi-mahi, salmon, sirloin, to name a few of the wonderful meals you can create with this smoker. Very easy to use and well worth the 20-30 minutes (follow the directions) you need to complete the meal.Works on any stovetop or your grill. The best part is that you can smell the smoke but you dont see any it anywhere. Another great benefit is that you can add flavor with adding calories.",1

So many convenient plot twists that came along just as mechanisms to advance the story did not seem natural (think about Jerry calling Roy out of the blue to make sure that he has not given up the case. HUH?) and so much was useless to the plot and the ending at the farm ... pu-leaze.I've heard good things about Abrahams, so maybe I would try another, but I thought this novel was a real waste of time",0

2759,"Not Worth the Money!: It is a decent action game. However, it is not like the previous three games where you have the opportunity to walk around and explore Hogwarts - there is none of that, no interior Hogwarts at all to walk through. You don't really lean any new spells they just occupy one button on your controller. ALso, they totally did away with Fred and George's Joke shop and now you use your beans to gain strength through wizarding cards but the whole thing is just stupid. I, like 20+ others that I know, am completely disappointed and feel that the game, was a waste of money. It was absolutely no fun at all to play. It's just a bunch of tasks outside of Hogwarts - you don't see an interior of the castle at all. Save your money.",0

2765,"I hate titles: Despite the obvious Joy Division similarities, it's still a fantastic album. 80s post-punk, maybe. But since when is 80s post-punk a bad thing? I have to admit that it's one of my all time favorite records, but I can understand how one may not enjoy it. And that's fine. But don't go around putting one star ratings just because Interpol totally ripped off Joy Division. I honestly don't think Ian Curtis would mind, people.It's really too bad ""Antics"" is so mediocre.",1
2766,"Excellent: The key for me was a scope I could effectively use with recently acquired behind-the-ear hearing aid with microtube and dome, for severe high-frequency hearing loss, in my left ear only.The soft ear pieces of a colleague's Littman Cardiology led me to decide on the purchase of this scope. The soft earpieces of the Classic II SE seal well and comfortably over the microtube, without removal of the hearing aid.

I don't think this was at all a fitting follow up to 101 Dalmatians, but it was still okay. It had it's very high and very low points. There is this parrot in the movie that almost makes it a must see. He is so funny, but the plot is so rambling disconnected that it is almost no fun to watch between the parrot scenes. Some points in the plot I would say is just total cheap duplication, but some points are drastically different and really boarding on good, but it always seemed that as soon as they got close to good they'd jump away. The characters didn't feel intense to me anymore. It seemed like a cheap shadow of the first.",0

Fun book to read with your child, especially if you are a dog lover!",1

This band has brought me back to it in a huge way and introduced me to a bunch of other bands that I never knew existed 3 years ago. While Trace is still my favorite, and Straightaways was good, in spite of some less than enthusiastic reviews, this album reminds me of UT's Anodyne album. Jay Farrar is one of the best songwriters out there, in any musical genre. I saw them live for the first time in Somerville, MA about a week before the album came out. It was supposed to be an all acoustic show, but they were all plugged in during the second half of the show and they kicked ass!

And I won't deny that I read it from beginning to end. However, I just wanted it to end, and I felt I was wasting my time through the last third of the book. The ending is abrupt and out of sync with the rest of the book. The characters are contrived, and manipulated to fit into scenes and settings. I don't recommend it to you.",0
2783,"Great suggestions, but some are common knowledge: My pregant friend told me about this book so I decided to read it. I'm not pregnant yet. There are 1,000 ideas in list form throughout the book and most of them I find to be very helpful. There are web sites listed in the book where you can sign up and receive coupons for all sorts of baby items. Instead of doing your own searching to compile a list, they are already there in the book for you.I do think this book could have been shortened a little to maybe 850-900 ideas since some of these ""bargains"" are just practical things you would have thought of or done anyway. That's the reason I didn't give it five stars.Overall, I think it's a great informative book for those who are trying to save a little money. I will reread this book again when pregnant.",1

But if you are willing to spend some time thinking about what you are reading and want to look at the Old and New Testaments in a fresh light, this is for you.If you want to get into all the arguments about whether the Book of Mormon can be squared with archaeology and other fields of study, you probably want to go tohttp://www.farmsresearch.com/or tohttp://www.fairlds.orgOtherwise, just read the book and think about it.

I contacted a service center and they want $100 just to look at it and $95/hr to fix it! Not worth the money we paid and this is the second Lexmark that has fallen apart. I realize that we have had it for 3 yrs, but it has not been used hard and why should we pay the price of the copier again. When it did work, it worked ok.

The book delivers on its promises of teaching one how to manifest dreams, desires, and 'if only's'......I needed discipline to work my way through the first step, and after that, the understanding and wisdom poured forth through Ghalil's words. I learned how to 'harness' my thoughts, so my mind could stay open to only positive input. Once I completed my Trueprint and Trinity, my world changed rapidly. I now had the tools to guide me on a daily basis through a myriad of professional and personal 'bumps'......it was truly surprising to view others reactions to me, that I was guiding through my Trueprint.

2798,"For the price--nice! But colors subtler than shown: I got these on a today's deal, and I have to admit, I'm pleased with them. They are pretty, are actually a good size for my ears (not tiny-hard-to-see size).The colors are MUCH subtler than the picture amazon has here. But, that said, they still are attractive and usable. A good everyday sort of set of earrings. If you wear a lot of pastels or pale colors and like the feminine look of pearls, I say get it. Not expensive, discreet, pretty.Mir",1
2799,"A Mockumentary of Greek/Roman Mythology?: I believe I was about three-quarters through this book when I finally realized had been gnawing on my brain: this book is little more than a charming romp through mythology. Do not let that ""little more"" line let you think I have a negative opinion of this book. Quite the opposite.As many books nowadays combine fairy tales, this throws peninsula/island mythology into a single adventure and cleverly and kindly removes the fantastic from them in favor of a sweetly simpler light. The supposed great heroes are mere, loveable individuals that dig their ways into the heart.The story is funny, charming, and distinctly Alexander. The characters are his usual, but if you are a fan of this characters and the Lloyd Alexander format, this will be certain to please.",1

I have a 27 speed road bike and I had to run my bike in the highest gear there was which made the magnetic unit whine and vibrate terribly. I rode for an hour and hardly broke into a sweat. I had a Giant Cyclatron which I liked but the bearings went bad after 4 1/2 years. I think I'll fix and go back to that.,0

2802,"Still a great movie, too bad the visual quality is poor: I'm sorry to downgrade this movie, one of my favorites, from 5 stars to 4, but the quality of the DVD is poor. Obviously, the film from which this DVD was made has deteriorated badly over the years - color shifts from frame to frame, lots of little fallouts, and some pretty major film damage. The digital medium gives such a beautiful reproduction of the film that these glitches are painfully obvious. If you can get past them, though, it's still a great family film. The widescreen format makes it all the more awesome of a film than in VHS format. And the sound separation, as another reviewer remarked, makes it a joy to listen to.",1

Every time you go to a different area in the game, the camera view changes!!!!!! It is soooooooooo annoying!!! Also, this makes it very hard to find out where you are going. The graphics in the game are teeeerible!!!! They look like playstation 1 graphics! Right now, I'm on the last level (which isn't very hard to get to because there's only 10 levels) and I can't beat it because my objectives won't tell me what to do!!

2811,"Can't believe my good fortune!: I've wanted a copy of this film for years. It's not the best performed movie. It's not the best directed movie. It is a movie with a special place in my heart and my old copied-from-cable VHS tape finally gave up the ghost. I was surprised by the reasonable price and the ease with which I located a copy of my very own. I tried to buy this movie years ago and discovered it was only available to movie rental stores and the cost was prohibitive as it included a licensing fee.My DVD arrived in just three days despite ordering standard shipping. It was just as camp as I remembered it and I laughed until it hurt. My daughters didn't get the humor, so ""Naked Space"" may not be for the under 35 crowd. However, those of us for whom ""Alien"" was a theatrical experience will, no doubt, at least get several chuckles from it.",1

As soon as I attempted to go online, my system crashed, went to the 'blue screen of death' and dumped all memory. I tried repositioning memory modules to no avail. Removing the newly installed memory returned my computer to normal. Amazon was great about the return. I printed off a return label and had no issues returning the memory for a quick refund.

It is not that I am oppossed to futuristic books, have you read JD Robb(Nora Roberts) Death series? I found the plot very difficult to follow, especially if it was not read in one sitting. Each time I came back to it I needed to do a quick review. Too much ""rez this and rez that"". Also, I found the interaction of Lydia and Emmett to be very cold . No chemistry here.

This film tries so hard to be edgy, provocative, and clever but the director fails to achieve any kind of dark humor.

There are some graphic and grotesque images in American Psycho, not for the faint of heart. I just couldn't stand this movie, pretty ordinary.",0

I haven't had any problem with hundreds of other television shows and movies I've bought, manufactured by Paramount or Sony. Stop cutting corners, Universal. And double-sided DVDs? Give me a break! I'm going to buy other discs from other companies before I even think about buying the subsequent seasons of Leave It to Beaver--at least until Universal fixes this problem. This sort of stuff is tarnishing their name, and it will affect my purchasing decisions.",0
2822,"It does the job: I've enjoyed my blender and processor. I like the wave action of the blender, and the fact that the jar is made of plastic and not glass. The blender we bought right before this one, and returned within a couple weeks, broke when the ice hit the side. My blender before that fell off the sink and shattered, so I was tired of the glass. The only complaint is the really loud and sometimes ear piecing sound it makes when trying to blend ice and frozen fruit. Otherwise, it has been great. The processor has been good. I try to blend nuts to powder and it does a fairly decent job. It leaves a lot of bigger chunks, I just have to live with that our strain them out. The processor does NOT come with the shredding attachment that most processors come with, it only comes with the S-blade.

But, they have a tendency to scratch easily, and after having them about 9 months with spring here. I have noticed that the winter was very hard on them, or they're just cheaply made.

It took 5 minutes to get the Netgear out of the box, hooked to my cable modem, and all 3 computers hooked to the box and running on my new local network! It uses a web interface which was very easy.Further, it understands that some cable modem providers are trying to limit you to one computer -- the setup screen automatically asks if you want to spoof you MAC address to ensure you can have multiple computers behind your new firewall.Opening ports for Web and FTP servers, as well as Netmeeting, etc. was also very easy.

2829,"Great Disappointment: I am very unhappy with the Coby mp-c858.The ""thumb-toggle"" control for navigation is almost counter-intuitive. The ""press/push"" combination has very little feedback feel. That makes it difficult to switch between the various modes of operation or fast forward/rewind through a track.Even worse, it is hard to get files downloaded properly. I copied files to the unit and they would show up on Windows Explorer. When I tried to play them back, the unit wouldn't recognize they were there.Some of these difficulties may be operator error. If the available documentation wasn't so sparse and imprecise, I might be able to tell for sure if the problems of using this are mine or the player's.The FM Radio does work, though again, it's challenging to navigate. Likewise the voice recorder.It looks like this is going to be just an overpriced memory stick for me.",0

While the facts were all there on the case, the overall editing of the Kindle version and the organization of the book were terrible.There were many times while reading that I would have to re-read an entire paragraph a number of times just to figure out what the authors were trying to say. It seemed like the manuscript was given to a monkey to type in for the digital version and then was quickly run through a spell checker.In addition, the overall organization of the book was poor. It jumped around in years as the authors changed point of view and made it difficult to follow the chain of events.While the information on the case was interesting, I would not suggest this book to anyone planning on reading it on a Kindle. There must be better versions.",0

McEwan does a wonderful job of wading through the educational jargon, identifying the major issues being debated today, and giving a brief history of the evolution of public schools in the US. The book is full of relevant anecdotes and is heavily footnoted.While McEwan makes no secret of her traditionalist views, her critical treatment of progressivism is abrupt and consequently shallow. My suspicion is that many of the progressivist ideas have merit, but incompetent implementation of those ideas has resulted in such prominent failures that the ideas themselves are condemned. McEwan simply fails to make this distinction.Overall, though, this was a great book that defied me to put it down.",1

2868,"Prostituted Potential: I picked up ""Woman in the Dunes"" with a rather high expectancy, I put it down feeling somewhat robbed. The weakness of this novel does not derive from the unique plot, but rather the way it prostitutes itself, allowing such bland descriptions. Kafka, one of my favorite authors and one cited as similiar to Abe, has been accused of a journalistic style. However, it is not his style - which is endlessly inventive and consuming - but rather his word choice that is so. Abe, on the other hand, is simply banal, monotonous (I couldn't count the many passsages speaking of spit and sand, come on no matter how diffrently you say it, its still spit and sand) and non-descriptive. Think diffrently, just look over the first chapter.Also, I found the erotic elements of the story to be pretensious, shallow, and that dreaded of all words, ""cheesy."" Perhaps it is not so bad, it is simply its potential that has driven it into the ground. Such a brilliant narrative deserves its due credit.",0

It is difficult to use - hard to clean, has a tendancy for the coffee grounds to overflow and clog the carafe opening causing coffee to spill all over the counter, etc. Recently the mill stopped grinding altogether and I thought I'd keep it anyway and just grind the beans separately but after the third overflow in two weeks we are chucking this baby out!",0

Opened it still sitting around the tree and its missing all the kindling rack parts! Oh yeah and it has 3times the parts for feet.

Never got the screws but did get pieces of the kindling rack twice! No thanks enclume. Too many other places we can get similar products! Merry Christmas honey!b",1
2878,"You need this cookbook: Cooks Illustrated is like Consumer Reports for recipes. They experiment, evaluate, and come up with, well, the Best Recipe for anything you want to make. I've had their original Best Recipe cookbook for some time. My son recently gave me the Light version. I've made many dishes from both books and have yet to come across a recipe that isn't (you guessed it) the Best Recipe. I especially love the Best Light Recipe because they don't lower their standards to cut calories. Their turkey chili, for example, is better than most full-fat beef chili recipes I've tried. You get full nutritional info, of course, which makes it a snap to calculate Weight Watchers points. If you could only own one cookbook . . . (you know the rest)",1

Duvall, usually a marvelous actor is wooden, tired, Wahlberg also usually marvelous, literally phones his lines in and Phoenix who was simply brilliant as Johnny Cash relies on twitches and tics to indicate emotion in his character. A fine bunch of supporting actors given dull dialogue in an even duller plot. An uninspired shame of a movie, not even good enough to be given B status.",0

Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.",0
2886,"Lousy, pop, reductionistic scientism: I've been reading a lot of books and articles about evil lately, and this is about the worst. Shallow, reductionistic, pop publishing. Mostly a stringing together of various and sundry studies related to morality, with semi-coherent and semi-informed interpretations of them. In the end, it's a lot of evolutionary psychology. In parts it is simply an argument against religion. If this is the kind of crap that most people are reading, no wonder our culture is in the sorry state it is in. I instead higyly recommend Vetlesen's Evil and Human Agency (Cambridge) and Claudia Card's The Atrocity Paradigm: A Theory of Evil, for readers who really want to understand evil.",0
2887,"Beware of the hidden costs: I've had this detector for over 3 years now and it's true what they say about it needing calibration every year. This means sending the unit back to the manufacturer for service. If you don't, it tends to sneak up with progressively higher readings. Unfortunately, I found this out after I bought it. So here's the thing you will need to consider: you are paying $130 for 1 year of ballpark accuracy readings. After that it will cost you another $75 (+2 way S&H fee to Michigan) per year just to maintain the same reading accuracy. Seems like a high price to pay when you can have a professional come in yearly and give you a more accurate reading for about the same price. Granted, readings can change daily to weekly but in my three years of measuring, I've found that the detection range was pretty consistent (within 2-2.5 pCi/L seasonal differential). Now I have this $130 device that needs another $100 or so to make it semi-useful again.",0
2888,"Engaging and novel way to introduce Jesus's friends: Jesus and the 12 Dudes Who Did is an engaging and novel way to introduce Jesus's friends to young children.

As they learn something special about each ""dude"" and touch each one they experience that just like themselves each one is distinctive and special to Jesus.",1

Good, solid, heft. Nice glass pitcher, wide mouth and base, and plenty of speed/power options. And, it all comes apart for thorough cleaning.But, when making smoothies, it would leave big frozen lumps. And the wide mouth doesn't have much of a spout, so lumpy smoothies or soups don't pour well and drip down the side. Plus, it seemed un-usually loud at any setting. Within a few months, it started leaking. I traced the leak to a hair-width crack in the blade housing, which quickly became a total failure. The blade is now in two separate pieces.[...]",0

I thought it was a great idea for TMBG to move into music geared more toward kids, and loved their prior release, ""No!""However, I don't think that this CD measures up to what TMBG has done in the past. Part of the problem with the CD is that it is music from the DVD, and some of the songs on the DVD are very visual (e.g., ""Letter Shapes""). There are a few songs that are enjoyable just on the CD (my favorites are ""Alphabet of Nations"" and ""Z Y X""), but if you want to really enjoy this release, forgo the CD and just buy the DVD.Also, just so that I wouldn't be posting only my adult comments on this product, I showed the DVD to my two nephews (ages 1 and 4), and they got bored after about the third song and asked to watch The Wiggles instead.",0

If that is the case, you probably have an issue (especially if you say things like ""Man, I don't have time to read this book now.. I'll get it later when I have more time"".

He harshly criticizes anyone who dares to not hold to a preTrib rapture viewpoint. He calls other viewpoints ""demonically inspired"" at one point, which I find particularly angering and unreasonable.It's okay to have a particular opinion regarding escatology, and even to thing that those who disagree with you are wrong, but it's not okay to publish such a damning condemnation of other viewpoints when the Bible isn't clear. Dr. LaHaye steps far over the line with this book by cruelly attacking viewpoints totally within the realm of orthodoxy.",0

You're greeted by dumb one-liners that aren't funny and the film gets tiring incredibly fast. If the dialogue had been predictable, that would have been fine, but it was unpredictably dumb.Frankly, it seems that whoever wrote the script just thought: ""I've got to get all these different elements of CA in the film - how can I do that as quickly as possible.""I'll say this: if you have a child who has no concept of WW2, military matters, how to hold and fire a gun, and can't understand the English language: they very well might enjoy this film.",0

The author had a wonderful story going here until the end, when you are left hanging. I have never liked books that leave open storylines.

Instead of the raw fuzzy garage guitar and banging drums, listeners are exposed to over-produced generic FM Rock. The Mooney's songs were engaging in the first place, and anyone with any decent music tastes who bothered to listen to their music would come to like it. The production on ""Electric Sweat"" was definately good enough. There was no reason to go with such a high producer. Also, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEATHER JACKETS,SOMETHING HAS TO BE THE SAME! I am giving this album 2 stars because it's the Mooney Suzuki and their earlier material is Prime A+ Garage.

2946,"NO DOUBT THE WORST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!: There are absolutely no good song on the CD.The only reason to buy this CD is if you have a sleeping problem,it will put you out cold within the first 5 minutes of listening.For any other reason than that,stay away from this horrible album!!!",0

2948,Poor Quality Roller Carrying Case: I have used this case for 30 days and the wheels are already wearing out. The telescoping arm is a joke. It does not stay up when you want it to and it will not receed when trying to lower the handle. Very poor quality.,0
2949,"Another excellent rip-off designed by MicroSoft...: Only after purchasing this kit did I discover how inadequate and incomplete this set is. You would think since the tests are engineered by Microsoft you could at least depend on them providing sufficient study material, especially for the price the set goes for. This is not the case. There are enough holes in the information provided for you to drive a semi through and never get near the sides. Just try taking some of the example exams and see how far you get on the information provided in this set. My advice is steer clear of this one and spend your money on MCSE books that really prepare you for the exam.",0

2951,"NOT Phillippine Brand if ordered from Eauction!!!: I ordered Philippine Brand dried mangoes from Eauction and they sent Royal brand dried mangoes instead. The photo and the brand and manufacturer list Philippine Brand. Only way down the page in the description does it actually mention ""Royal Brand"" mangoes from the Philippines. If I'd known these weren't the product being advertised, I'd never have paid $18 for the bag. The Philippine Brand dried mangoes are worth it. The Royal Brand mangoes are not.Buyer beware!!! This is a bait and switch.I can't speak to any dried mango products purchased through other sellers, only Eauction.",0
2952,"Surprisingly great album!: This is an excellent album for anyone who is getting sick of the more traditional Christmas music. Blackmore's Night does some very original-sounding renditions of Christmas songs with great instrumentation. The ocharina on ""I Saw Three Ships"" is particularly enchanting. This album includes ""Wish You Were Here,"" which was a pleasant surprise. I lent this album to a friend and didn't get it back, which I would take as a positive endorsement...",1
2953,mediocre: I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER,0
2954,"Room for improvement, but still a good read: The history of language is a fascinating thing. It's a tough thing to trace in some cultures where writing wasn't developed, and where writing was developed we can only guess what it sounded like before audio recording equipment was developed. This book give a good history of all we know about language starting from first principles of where language developed and how it works in lower animals.The evolution of European languages is what I was most interested in, and I'm pleased with the depth that Fischer goes into. Prose is a difficult medium to use to get across the spread of languages though, and I think that better use of diagrams and maps would have been in order. (Ideally, an animation would be the only way to truly explain it.)The only other problem I had with this book was the chapter about the history of the study of linguistics, which I didn't find terribly interesting, and I skipped to the end of that part.Still a good read though.",1

2956,"Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country).",1
2957,Rad is as rad as we remember!: This movie was loved by our family especially by the kids and it was hard to find on DVD. We were thrilled when we found it!,1
2958,"Huh?: My kids and I love the cartoon and this movie was supposedly based on the cartoon. But if that was the case, WHY would you change the pronunciation of the MAIN characters name??? It was very confusing to a 5 year old. And that was just the beginning. I know it would be difficult to adapt 3 seasons to the big screen, but I swear whoever wrote this didn't even watch the cartoon.So, in conclusion, if you LOVE the cartoon, you will probably not like the movie. On it's own, if you have never seen a single cartoon, then you might like it for the action, but that's about it.",0

2962,"Best Iron on earth: I ordered this iron after using my mother's. My sister also bought this iron after one use of it. It heats up quickly and irons out even the toughest wrinkles. The steam button is my favorite feature and it can blast through a stack of laundry on no time. The cord is also nice and long allowing for great freedom of movement. I have seen this iron for sale at stores for much, much more money, so I also feel like I got the best price. Seriously...if you are in the market for a new iron...look no further.",1
2963,"A great addition to the radio flyer wagon: I brought this canopy for our radio flyer wagon about one month ago and yesterday was the first time we used it with the wagon. We spent the whole day at the zoo and we got so much compliments because it really looks good with the wagon, but most importantly it provides a good shade for my daughter.The cons of the canopy is that it takes up quit a bit of storage space at home and in the car. You either have to take down the cover and fold everything or you can just lay it over the wagon. Either way, you will need some extra storage for it. Since I've read from previous reviews that its kinda of filmy. So, throughout the trip, we were very gentle with it and it still looks and feels good. Well, that's base on only one day of usage. I just hope that it will last!! The price is about $20 higher than when I purchased it one month ago, so... with the price that I paid, I have no complaints.Overall, I am still very satify with the purchase.",1
2964,First use broken: I purchased this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She just used it for the first time and the little black thing that lets the steam out came off and dropped into the pot. She also reported to me that she could not find the rubber piece that the little black think goes onto in her soup. I have to inquire for her how to return it since it has been a month since I bought it from Amazon. Hopefully it will not be a problem.,0
2965,"Where have you gone Bernie Goldberg . . .: Goldberg is one of the most brilliant broadcast reporters I have ever witnessed; and one of the dumbest writers on record. For a guy who has so closely guarded his bias throughout his work as an Emmy winner, he sure has stepped on his unit with this effort. It verifies the old journalistic ethic that those in the business should never let their biases be known. I cannot believe he actually wrote this. It is not that well written, a far cry from his broadcast work. He is not even handed or objective in his assessments. Even in a work as subjective as this, one should be fair in arriving at a conclusion and he has not done so here.This leads me to ask the obvious question: Does Bernie do the real work when he is on the telly or did someone ghost-write this piece of garbage?Sorry Bernie, stick to air.",0
2966,"Stretching it: I love techni sci fi. Throw in some drama and I thrive. This is more of a Clive Cussler meets Space 1999 (Remeber that one? Martin Landau)which I guess is close but will have many armchair critics dismiss me.The writing form of the writer is actually good, the premise of the story is difficult to hold. DT to hold back a vacume? I think not, but I'd ask Mythbusters for a final judgement on that point if for entertainment value alone. I'm an easy reader and entertaining is all I ask. It was entertaining but not for the best of reasons.",0
2967,"Wouldn't watch it....ever....again: Kit Kitterage was whiny and seeming a bit snotty. She overacted and just the way she looked at people in the movie was like ""I'm better than you."" She basically told the kid Sterling you have big ears which no one wants to hear. She just seemed like a brat and annoying how she was yelling at the guy at the news place. Abigall Breslin overacted and it wasn't a very good movie or a ""classic"" people make it out to be. Overall the movie was a flop.",0
2968,"Shaken NOT stirred!: A strange book indeed. Aside from the amazing feats Perkins accomplishes with such mediocre intellectual capital, one should also be impressed by the flower child in him who endured for so long the role of an international pirate extraordinaire. One can also feel a Bond complex behid all this. There is a surreal feel to the whole book not to mention some really bad writing.Of course Corporate America aims to enrich its coffers first and above all. Is anyone really surprised by this revelation?The grand scheme of US generals of capitalism and ""deep state"" to control and conquer the World is blown up to impossible proportions. If only these people had displayed a fraction of these skills in managing their corporations and our wars.Unfortunately many of the events and tragic fates of various leaders of countries who tried to resist the US hegomonic policies are closer to truth than fiction. In fact, much of this is printed in your newspaper everyday in gory detail.",0

2971,"Suggest the Sunset book Curb Appeal instead: I recently purchased two books on curb appeal. This book by Creative Homeowner, written by Megan Connelly, uses only estate-size houses. The houses are almost all 98% probably 6,000 square feet or more. While it is well written, it does not show before and after pictures. Instead it just explains the finished photo and what gives it curb appeal. If you own a house of 1500-4000 square feet, I recommend Sunset Curb Appel book: exciting ways to enhance the appearance of your home. The homes are more modertately scaled, they show before and after photos, and you also get an idea of the ""big picture"". You can see that you don't have to take on the entire process at one time. And, you can see that small fixes have big appeal.",0
2972,"I only made it through Chapter One: I got this book from the library and was pretty excited to start reading it. It's possible that most of the book is great, but I won't find out as I struggled to make it through the first chapter before returning it. That chapter is filled with nothing but long lists of ""this guy did that"" and ""another guy did something else"" that was boring, disconnected and pretty repetitive.I guess it's possible the author felt he had to lay down the foundation for the rest of the book, but the first chapter was absolutely brutal to read.If you're interested in the book, I'd suggest you skim (or even skip) the first 40 pages or so.",0
2973,"Yum.: Two words: space opera.I'm willing to put up with a lot from a game for quasi-original space opera (ie - not star wars). Xenosaga was pure ambrosia. The storyline was pleasently complex without being convoluted for the sake of confusion and nothing else. And, wonderfully, the driving force behind this game was not the next shiny doo-dad you could get upon levelling up, but instead the ::shock:: story.The cut scenes were long, and that did bother me towards the beginning of the game. It was a little frustrating in that I really couldn't play the game unless I had at least an hour of free time. The combat system was fun and rather flexible. I didn't use the mechas much and that didn't hinder me at all.space ship space ship space ship space ship zoooooooooom!",1
2974,"Powerful singer - Powerful Message: Judy Jacobs is so overlooked when it comes to contemporary Christian music. The power and sincerity of her singing really has a strong effect on me. I heard her first on TBN on tv and from then on I was hooked.My favorites on the album are ""Lord God of Abraham"" and ""Almighty Reigns"" because they are so upbeat. But I also enjoyed ""Worthy"" which is a much slower tempo. The other songs are good as well.",0

2977,"Well, SHUT my mouth: I watched the 'making of' to see how this lame excuse for spiritual enlightenment got made. I was shocked to find that: it was a best selling novel, that the screenplay (LOL) was written by the writer who also produced it and according to his claims there were many studios that were interested in making the movie. They should have let the studios make it because this is the lamest dialog I've heard since The Matrix and this self rightous gobbly-goop stinks worst than Star Wars. They must of said prophecy forty times in the first half hour. This can only be equealed by the repetition of Fordo in Lord of the Rings.I'm curious to see if the book is as bad as the movie but I'm a slow reader and I do believe. I do believe I've wasted enough time on this already. Want to watch something spiritually uplifting? Watch ""The Song of Bernadette"".

2983,"over-the-top prose that smacks of racism and elitism: I was very eager to read this book after having enjoyed The Secret History - but boy, what a bummer! This book feels like it's 5,000 pages long and very familiar. It's like a campy pastiche of cliches from other famous, better books. Even the main character's name seemed contrived - Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, how is one supposed to pronounce that? I am relieved to see that other readers noticed the slightly racist tone of parts of the book. I would like to add that there is classism at foot here too - i.e. Tartt's reprehensible portrayal of the white trash characters, used primarily as comic relief. I wonder how Tartt would feel if she were on the receiving end of that. There is a noticable lack of humanity in these pages that results in boredom. Ten years to produce what? A faux great novel. Can't recommend it, sorry. I hope she get sher act together again. It's just a cryin' shame.",0

After the first episode I hastily took the brand new velour shirt I owned and created a Star Fleet uniform, of sorts, with a lttle artwork, cardboard, scissors,Elmer's Glue, and a saftey pin--voila, the newest Star Fleet officer in the neighborhood! When I saw this movie I was ready to get my old uniform out of mothballs--alas, it would never fit again even I still had it. First generation Trekkies, you can put your uniforms back on and feel like teenagers again! The Captain is indeed back on the bridge after 40 years!",1

Unfortunately, I have found this bottle to be worthless for anything except storing pumped breast milk. It is extremely difficult for my daughter to suck anything out of this nipple. I too have found leakage from the nipple ring, making for a very sloppy feeding session. I have since bought and used the Playtex VentAire bottles and haven't had any difficulties. The shape of the Playtex VentAire bottles are also much easier for feeding. I would not reccomend the Avent to anyone unless their baby has an impressively strong suck.",0

2994,"Wholesome. Wonderful. A great story.: There is nothing not to like about this little book. It is well written, colorful and unique. From the moment we meet Mma Ramotswe and follow her story from girlhood, through an abusive marriage and into her ambitious foray as the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, she earns our respect and admiration-just as she shows respect and admiration for everything around her. Alexander McCall Smith captures the character and culture of Gaborone, a village in Botswana, and tells a sweet and entertaining story. I've noticed other reviewers label it a mystery; however, in my opinion it is a series of mysteries--one about a missing boy kidnapped by witch doctors winds through the book, and others unfold in each chapter where new cases are presented to the fledgling agency. A wonderful and charming book, which I highly recommend.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.",1

One other time only I remember being so caught up in the fictional life of a powerful character , specifically when I read Philip Roth's Sabbath Theatre .As far as the overall writing technique, it's perfect.

I enjoyed everything about this book. I didn't read ""Running"" even though I looked at it several times - just seemed too sad. However I was drawn to Dry and I am so glad I read it. It's a rare book that I want to read again - but I think I will with Dry.",1

3026,"Not a very scientific book: I have a background in Science, but I think the argument Mr. Sagan is making is not a very sound one. To rationally argue that science is ""better"" for mankind, you have to define an evaluation criteria of what makes human life better. He does not do that and tries to provide examples of how science helps move human life forward on the values that are present today. And then he mixes up many things...its just not great",0
3027,"Horrid book by a heartless woman: I was given this book to read shortly after coming out to a relative, back in the early nineties. What a cruel joke that was. Luckily, my relative has since learned how terrible that move was. A large portion of this book is dedicated to Ms. Johnson's gay son and the ""burden"" placed upon her by his very being. She is proud to say that she has estranged herself from him. There's nothing funny, sweet, or even mildly loving about that.",0

3029,"Fantastic MPB and Bossa Nova: I cannot believe it took me this long to ""discover"" this CD. It is remarkable with terrific tracks and a seemingly natural flowing feel about it. From the opening track, you are transported to Brazil and have the feel of the music and the inspiration of the new movement and the next generation of Brazilian musicians and stars.The biggest standout track to me is Joyce's ""Aldeia de Ogum"". It displays her range and the shows how she could use her voice as an instrument just like the other top divas of Sarah Vaugh and Flora Purim. Other notable artists were Edu Lobo, Marcos Valle, Eumir Deodoto and Milton Banana Trio.After giving it a listen, you wonder why Sergio Mendes version of Ponteio wasn't included. But it doesn't stop you from enjoying it. I recommend this CD.",1
3030,"Good, solid, interesting: The 2002 A's lost some big-name players to major-market teams, because management didn't have the big bucks needed to keep them on the roster. With their limited budget, the A's couldn't compete for players in the standard way, so their manager, Billy Beane, built a team using a brand-new approach to player-evaluation. It was a huge risk and hugely unpopular. The movie shows what happened next.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill portray Billy Beane and his number-crunching assistant in this very enjoyable flick.",1
3031,"my cat wouldn't go for it: Maybe it's a good idea but... My cat just wouldn't go for it. I guess she's set in her ways. I tried and tried ""training"" her but she has no interest in eating her food away from her food dishes. She's unusual in that she won't touch people food, and the only food she'll eat that's offered to her outside of her food dish is an occasional cat food ""treat."" (She's not picky about her food, but obviously feels it belongs in her dish and not on the floor in other areas of the house.) I wasn't happy stepping on stray pieces of dry food laying around the floors either.So...Didn't work for us.",0

3033,"Inspiring story of overcoming fears and childhood struggles: This is such a great movie for teens and adults. It focuses in on a man who inherited a position of royalty, although he in himself did not have the confidence or ability to lead through public speaking, let alone with family & friends. This story of overcoming all odds with the help of a dedicated therapist was inspiring and moving. A great movie for reminding us that all things are possible if we do not give up, and seek help in areas of weakness. I will be ordering a copy soon!",1
3034,"Ugh, don't bother!: As a teen living with women who love words, I get a lot of great gifts in the form of books. And I like Charles de Lint. EXCEPT when he is writing for or about us young 'uns. His teenage characters are bland, often stupid in their inexperience, and they talk like no real teenager I've ever met. Even the two Newford stories included in this volume, ostensibly written for adults, are just - boring, and unrealistic, and preachy.It's apparrent - and de Lint says as much in his intro - that what we have here is a publisher (or perhaps an editor, Ms. Windling?) bent on wringing every last cent out of de Lint's fame, so they cobbled this thing together for the ""youth market,"" knowing people like my loved ones would trustingly scoop it up to gift young fans. They got gulled. Don't let it happen to you!",0
3035,"dont buy this!: If you compare this game to hit and run, well... you just cant. Do not paly this game after playing hit and run. THis game is so unrealistic that it is boring. You can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but it's just so repetitive. In the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth. They didn't even put time into making the level right. in mission mode you do different missions, but once again they are very repetitive. If your friend recommends this game (like mine) make sure to rent it before you buy it. Because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it here.rating out of ten: 2 1/2 - 3",0
3036,Learn Java by Association with C Cobol Fortran Pascal Visual: I am a VB programmer who wants to learn Java. This book is nothing it claims to be. One can't learn Java using it. Basically book is just a series of code examples with almost no comments and no clear and full explanations. It might be used as a quick reference but many examples of incorrect VB code I found in the book prevent me from trusting Java code examples. I wouldn't recommend to by this book: in my opinion it's a waste of money.,0
3037,"too much information: A reviewer lauded the fact that this book let you get to know Susan McElroy better. Why would one want to? She is spiritually and professionally connected to animals, yet eats them and gives them away when they become inconvenient details in her search for whatever it is that she is searching for. She moves from places she loves to find some more comforting, but elusive home ground. She gently dumps her husband and vows to remain a solitary womanspirit, only to have a new lover within three months. And who wants to read all their ""soul mate"" emails during their typically giddy courtship period. Not me....",0
3038,"Not that comfortable: I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me. Right out of the packaging, this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable, but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also, the product description says that it is designed for ""spin bikes"" and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes, so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike. However, it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it, even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible. This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs, which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times, but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand.",0
3039,"Very disapointing: I have many other of the Toy Vault Godzilla plushes, the large ones, and compared to them, this one is crap. First of all, it is almost not a plush at all only the antenna are plush. The rest of the figure is a clothy, almost vinyl material. Further, don't let the 14"" in the description fool you, this thing is practically tiny compared to the other large Toy Vault plushes. I would be disappointed with this for any price, but for the current high price, it is a joke.",0

3045,"Amateur comedy hour--- unwatchable!: I ordered this DVD after reading reviews that stated that it was funny and informative. My husband and I sat down to watch this DVD, as we are expecting our first child. We were unable to complete even the first section of the film due to the poor quality. To be specific, the production quality was extremely poor and seemed more like someone's home video. The two men who provide the information throughout the video were not remotely comedic, although many, many attempts at humor were made. It was outright cheesy and difficult to watch without wincing. It was a painful viewing experience for us both. If you need a parenting video, I would recommend that you look to something like the Laugh and Learn series, which offer DVDs on childbirth, breastfeeding, and newborn care by a qualified professional and a mother.",0

The older I get and the more I listen to it, though, the more I love it! Jewel puts so much emotion into her songs, and her lyrics are amazing. This is Jewel at her best. I don't care for her more recent music (I'm not much of a country fan), but her early stuff is brilliant. There are some fantastic love songs, as well as others that deal with some tough subjects.

3052,"Save your money: My Back to Basics 4-slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster WAS terrific for the first 5 times I used it. Then the toaster stopped working. The toaster was not a good one to begin with, as it toasted very unevenly and dried the bread out way too much. I did like the egg cooker though. But $60 for an egg poacher is way too steep, and that's all I now have for the money--an egg poacher and a pre-cooked meat warmer. I don't even have the heart to tell my husband how much money I threw away on this lemon. It's a shame too because we really enjoy Egg McMuffins and looked forward to making more of them. The 4-slot appliance takes up a lot of room on the counter. I really wanted to love this item. Save yourself money and counter space--use your microwave and buy a cheap toaster. Cheap toasters seem to last forever, and I'm quite certain they could make it past a measly 5 uses.",0

I did email (twice) explaining my dissapointment. No refund was offered.I finally found another site where I could purchase the song. The person sent me both the CD and the single and in addition to that, sent a sound bite to be sure he had the version I wanted. He did and I'm thrilled with the original recording.",0

3057,"Psychosexual Surgical Fantasies: What a wonderfully twisted, dark, demented little flick. I watched a rental of it, but now I WILL be buying my own copy for my movie collection.

3058,"No Skimping on Minor Arcana: Everyone else has already pointed out the absolute scrumptious artwork in this deck. I would like to add that the artists did not skimp on the minor arcana,as is so common in many other decks. The entire deck is gorgeous. Instead of being cutesey or cartoony, it actually has(in my opinion) a moody, serious tone. The cats take themselves, and your questions, very seriously. I started out doing a reading for a cat fanatic, humor expected, and instead we were bowled over by the messages. The tonal artwork gives the feel of alchemy, elegance, and undercurrents so often found in the old courts. I highly recommend this gorgeous deck as a means to enter another world to find your solutions. Blessings.",1
3059,"The Reverand Speaks: Reverand Maynard James Keenan. Is he a prophet speaking or just a person who is sick of mans interputation of religion. I'm guessing the later and I must agree with him. Its an unbelievable world we live in with so many things that seem so right and so many people trying to convince you that their interputation is the way to achive divine happiness. This album is a display that Tool will not follow anyone else's beliefs and have created their own. For anyone with doubts to listen and enjoy. Tool is the greatest band in the last 30 years, since the release of Pink Floyd, and everyone will realize this when the time is ready for them to take the main stage.",1
3060,Organized traditionals?: This CD of African music sounds a bit too organized and clean to be authentic. The charm and much of the soul of the tribal impression seems digitalized out to make a selling album out of it.Pity.I did however have part of the opening track Kulumbu as my ansaphone message a while ago. So the album is not useless. It's just too polished and undusty.,0
3061,"Why the British Empire collapsed: Reading James' book RAJ gives one a much clearer impression of why the UK was eclipsed in the 20th century: no sense of distance or perspective. This book is an okay introduction to a basic history of the English conquest of the Subcontinent; as far as anything approaching history from an unbiased perspective, it falls far short. Snippy remarks about Gandhi, entirely too much editorialization about Mountbatten, and a surreal disregard for the people who inhabited what has become India pervade and nearly ruin this book. While those whose country was colonized will understandably present an entirely different portrait of this century-plus of history, this is the exact opposite: an almost jingoistic portrayal of the Raj and the ""civilizing"" mission of the English in India. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who does not take what they read with a large dose of suspicion.",0

If she'd sung half the notes she sings on this cd it would have been too many - after one listening I'm completely melismatized.People think Mariah Carey defines over-singing. Not any more. Welcome to the new undisputed world champion. Just listen to the sample of ""Your Love"" (track 10) and get a taste of what you will find towards the end of all the other songs.On a good note, ""Friend Of Mine"" is a good tune and a great vocal arrangement, and if Kelly had sung a few notes less on this, I would have kept the cd.",0

3070,"Decent headset but nothing stupendous: I've had this item for about 3 months now. It easily mated with my 5310 XpressMusic phone. The multi function button is easy enough to use to power on/off the device, answer/initate a call, increase/decrease volume. (Nokia's bluetooth connection is horrid and so is their voice recognition.) I removed the stock earpiece and attached a Jabra ear-gel pad for an even better fit. It feels comfortable when using for long periods. It sill seems a bit large but maybe I was spoiled by using a bluetooth set w/out a behind the ear arm. Call clarity is good both ways. Battery life is very good. My only real gripe is that the range for this set is pretty lame. I can only go about 7 feet from my phone before I get the Rice Krispies ""Snap, Crackle Pop!"" interference. I bought the set for $19.99 at the time. If you can get it for around price it'd be a solid buy.",1

3091,"Easily the worst of the series: I always wondered why this movie was even made. It made no sense at all. From the begining I never even understood why Freddy has to posses someone's body in order to come back and terrify Springwood. Later on in the movie, it is impoosible to the way Freddy would haunt tenagers and dissapear in thin air, way too unrealistic and confusing. The part where Freddy came out of the boy's body and killed his friend was sick, and not very scary. A disgrace to the original. A good thing Wes Craven was involved in part 3 which should have been part 2.",0
3092,"Not just for entertaining but great for the kids too: I find the New Mrs Lee's Cookbook so versatile - It's so handy when I need to entertain and yet also contains good ideas for kids too. As a new mom, I find recipes like Sook Muy Tong (creamed corn and minced chicken soup), Lobah (shredded yam and meat) and Potato Balls easy to prepare and help take away the pain of trying to get the little one to finish his meals.By the way, this book is great as a gift too; the recipes are easy to follow and the photos are incredible - they really make your mouth water.",1
3093,"Why leave out ""Spanish Town"" & ""Why O""??: Great choice of tracks but why did they leave out Spanish Town & Why O, from Ghostwriter? Spanish Town has got to be one of the best tracks that he's put down and any collection is incomplete without it! For that reason, this only gets 4 stars.",1
3094,"Good: This is for my 61/2 lb American Hairless Terrier. I wanted it to go on the small console in the backseat, but the straps are too long for it to fit snugly there. It really only fits on the large console in the front seat and then you can't get into the storage compartment when you need things. We kept it, and figured out a way for it to be in the backseat. He will love being in the front seat between us when we are both traveling with him. I'll just have to take the things I need out of the compartment.",1
3095,"Laidback music: This is a great album for whoever likes ambient and moody music. If you are into Arab Strap, Mogwai etc this is a good buy.The Cd cover breathes an atmosphere of an evening with friends, wine and long talks. The same feeling you will get when listening to this album. Especially the opening track and track 6 are beauties. This album grows on you so you must give it a few turns to get the fullest out of it.",1
3096,"Great stuff!: This book is full of great ideas on low risk real estate investing. Little or no cash is needed with these techniques and you can easily generate cash flow with big pay days in the future. It's a great book for beginner investors as well as experienced investors wanting to explore the Lease Option techniques of investing. I'm sure Lease Options will become more and more popular as interest rates increase in the future, this book is a great way to learn the techniques from the masters.",1

3098,"Sublime is one of the best bands, this is as good as it gets: Sublime's self-titled album (in my view the best) has 17 tracks and 17 great songs. You will never get tired of this album. Sublime is able to incorporate so many different styles of music in such an irresistable way that this is easily my favorite album ever. The messages that Sublime sends bundled with the sheer quality of their music makes this a best-buy. Bradley Nowell will live forever in his music.",1
3099,"FINALLY!: I'll be first in line to get this one, but like the others, I think this was the worst season. Still such a good show - one of my all-time favorites! I just wish there were some extra features on the other seasons - I would have loved commentaries and outtakes. John Ritter was in some of the later episodes, and I would bet those outtakes were hilarious!",0

3101,"Geo Puzzles: These are the third and fourth Geo Puzzles I have purchased. My grandson loves them! I gave him one for his birthday and will keep one for Christmas. Sam has high-functioning autism. He is fascinated by geography and does these puzzles almost every day. They are sturdy, and I love the fact that the pieces are whole countries (or, in the case of the US one, states). It was a great day when I discovered Geo Puzzles! I keep thinking I should get a set for myself, since my memory for geography is not great.",1
3102,"Anti-creationism dressed up in a mountain of fancy talk: Anti-creationism dressed up in a mountain of fancy talk. You don't need a mountian of fancy talk to learn ""science"" isn't something to base your life on. The author seems very confused, in which he doesn't want people engaging in ""scientism"" and not to base your life on it, and that there's different types of science, and it shouldn't be closed off to new ideas, yet this guy sneaks in some asburd comments about creationism being pseudo science without ANY evidence. Yet clearly, his book is supposed to be against that type of discrimination. What a whopper of a mistake. This is just an anti-religionist trying to come across as reasonable, but fails, because he is against the very thing he's teaching: being open to what is reasonable.",0
3103,"a little on the cheap side: Recieved product as discribed. Thought quality wold be better than this. I have purchased many items from Opteka and all were higher quality than this unit.I have tried several times to get negatives in focus with this product and discovered that you have to play with the different macro lenses to get a proper focus on every negative.Also where the assy screws to the camera it just keeps spinning and never tightens. Threads look clean and undamaged on the unit and all my lenses screw properly and very easily to my camera adapter. The leveling part of the unit is ""turn in one direction only"", this part is very very tight and you have to use to much force to turn it making it very hard to get negative in a level position.If money wasnt so tight right now I would pay shipping to return it, but I cannot afford it so I will live with it.",0
3104,"Park Beat: This book has vivid, exciting, colorful illustrations and wonderful langauge. As an inner city elementary school reading specialist, I look for engaging books with a creative use of language. This book has rhythm and rhyme that may inspire many children to try to emulate the style and write their own book. Also, the language is rich and lends itself to a study of synonyms and words that appeal to all five senses. I took it out of the library and now I am adding it to my own.",1
3105,"not really a toy: I don't know why this is for age 8 and up like other Breyer horses. Breyer clearly labelled the box as not recommended for children..not a toy. It is a collectible model. My 11 yr old son has many Breyers and even at his age likes to really play with them. This is something to look at which is a little frustrating. As it was a very generous gift we will keep it, but its really for adults.",0
3106,"Miracles, the great show that nver was: I must say that I purchased this dvd because it showed up on my recommended list. I had never seen the t.v. series and was not sure what it was all about. I must say that I could not be more pleased. The acting is terrific! The story lines, are outstanding! If you believe in God or not, this is a series you should see. I'm just sorry that this series never got pass its' first season. If you watch this dvd you will see why I felt this way. It is really T.V. at its' best! If you watch, you will enjoy!",1

3108,"best western ever: Kevin Costner doesn't get credit for being as good of an actor as he really is. It's nice to be able to see Warner Bros. release a film in the Western genre that, for once, doesn't have anything to do with Clint Eastwood. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in ""Tombstone"" wasn't nearly as good as the one in this edition. I don't own the Digital Video Disc yet, so I'm not sure if I read something correctly which said that the actual three-hour feature is split onto two discs. I really hope it isn't.If you enjoy this biography of Earp, it won't seem like three hours. I have ADD and I can still sit through it. This movie and Nixon are the only three hour movies that I can sit through.",1
3109,"horrible.: not worth the $3 to rent. 3/4 of the movie is a close up profile view of ryan gosling's face while he's in his car. music sucks, AND only 1 chase scene. not worth 2 hours of your time. the little blonde chick is very hot though.",0
3110,Best lotion for baby!: This lotion is nice and light and non-greasy. And ofcourse it just makes the baby smell so fresh.,1
3111,"Nothing personal: Nothing personal is set in Northern Ireland during the 1970's, when the Troubles were at their height. The story centers on one memorable night when two former friends, one a UVF member and the other a humble catholic fatehr raising two children. The meaning of the title is most likely a comment on the war that has been going on for years, that the war is no longer about personal hated toward a specific person for anaction they had done, but for just what they represent. The movie isn't that centered but the ending does give off the message very clearly: Violence is wrong. Duh! We know that but the message comes heartbreakingly and most unfairly, but then again all violence is unfair.",0
3112,Excellent Comfort at Affordable Price: I have looked at a couple different Hammocks and for the money this was the most comfotable out of all because of the soft cotton design. Definetly worth the money I would only suggest selling with or buying a frame for it.,1

I recommended this product to a client a few months ago based on a variety of good reviews. they waited a while to order it from another supplier and didn't call me in until the 15 day return period expired. What a nightmare. After hours of wasted time on the phone with support, they ""escalated"" my problem and similar to other customer experiences, no return phone call. Now the client is stuck with a dead drive that will cost them more in my time to fix than it will to throw it away.Congratulations, Sony, on lowering the mark for product support and customer support. My first CD-R drive was a piece of junk sony in 1995 and this will be the last I ever recommend or buy.",0

3116,Review of digital product not the show itself: Throughout the stream the image was not good. The text is very jagged and noticeably pixelated plus the artifacting is just as bad. Between the blurry image and trying to read jagged subs I gave up trying to watch it. Also please mark shows dubbed or subbed ... would be nice for those who have a preference either way.,0
3117,"Zero Stars For Dull: Do not listen to the film buffs who call this ""art"" and a series of vignettes that defy any meaning, its worthless and boring. The whole film has no interest to offer, what it tends to portray is stuffy French poseurs who smoke and talk about nothing in particular, that isn't very entertaining. I was dragged to the ending finally and was exhausted by the absolute uselessness of this picture and of Godard himself who isn't a very capable film director.",0
3118,"Outstanding!: My roommate in college and I were both English majors. One night around eleven she walked out of our room while I was going in and said, ""I left a good book for you on the nightstand -- it's from my Adolescent Lit class."" Three and a half hours later I finished it. This is easily one of the most moving books I have ever read. The book begins in a seemingly normal setting, and then just when you get comfortable, it boosts you so far out of normal its amazing that Ms. Randle pulls it off. But she does, and she does it with a grace that is far too often absent in Young Adult fiction these days. The narrator has a wonderfully sincere and real tone. Her strengths, her fears -- her whole self shines through in the narration. The interpersonal relationships portrayed are right on the mark. I love this book. I think everyone should read it. It provides lessons for life that everyone should know.",1

I then tried the Harmoney 1100 but had to purchase the Harmony RF Extender which was not required with the 900. I am now convinced that the Harmoney 900 would have worked if I had purchased the Extender. In looking back, I would have preferred the 900, but at least the system now works.",1
3125,"Book falls short...: While the book has some good information and examples, it definitely doesn't take the reader through JNI in a clear fashion. Further, Liang shows his obvious bias against native code, and only spends one chapter discussing the procedure for embedding a JVM with C/C++.",0
3126,"Great machine but on/off button died: This is a solid machine. The design is great and most importantly, so is the coffee. It's pretty easy to use. My only complaint is that after 2.5 years, the on/off buttons are failing. Of course it's out of warranty and the only service shop is 40 min drive away (I live in NYC). It's a bit of a bummer as you would think that this should have held up for many, many more years.For this one mechanical reason, I am having a very hard time recommending this. Too bad as the espresso and cappuccinos it makes are great.",0

3130,"Just awful: Fellow reviewer David Bratman nailed it. This book is just god-awful. His summary that this book has the soul of a PowerPoint presentation is perfect.It's clumsy and boring. It's packed with errors and suppositions.It has no detail for the Hobbit timeline, which might have been worthwhile.It has a ridiculous preface claiming that the book will ""become a `must have' for all serious Tolkien fans."" The kicker is that this preface is written by the author himself. Laughable. (The Amazon page for this book actually includes this entire preface as part of the book description. Check it out. Note too the author's pleading of the book's various supposed virtues. It's totally amateur hour.)It all came together for me when I caught this amateur hack citing as an authority the biggest Tolkien hack of them all: David Day.",0
3131,"Astonishing but...: Astonishing work, but kind of falls apart at the end. Bowles is a master of out-of-the-ordinary psychologies, but the last 20 pages or so are beyond credibility.

3135,"A fresh look !: In Coulter’s new book I expected pretty much the same old witty, sarcastic liberal bashing Ann but I must say, “Wow” what a change! Although the author in the past has accused liberals of pretty much everything, in her new book Ann reaches out to the liberal cause and encourages conservatives to initiate dialogue with the “other side”. After reading through the book it would seem that Coulter has had a change of heart, and while one could hardly expect her to take up the liberal torch she does get the point across that the only way to build a better country is through conservatives and liberals communicating with each other. The book is full of helpful tips on how conservatives can initiate this process and plenty of examples on how the two sides can compromise on a whole array of issues. Perhaps a different side to Coulter that might put off a lot of her loyal followers but still a very good read.",0

3137,"Did John Gray rush to write this or what?: It seems like a book that was written in a rush. There are even typos in the book (he uses ""where"" instead of ""were"" and other spell check glitches...). Seems elementary. I couldn't read more than the first half and then I put it down. I was hoping for something insightful, but just got a dozen theories all jumbled into one book without much explanation.",0
3138,"Good stuff!: ...but not quite what I've been used to. I LOVED it, don't get me wrong, but I think that those who have complained about the difference in Shiloh's character have a point. However, I didn't like Island of the Innocent quite as much at the first reading, either (and I have but 15 minutes ago finished my first reading of this), and then it grew on me with successive readings.

3143,"OrangeJuicer: Upon using this juicer the first few times, I can see why this juicer received so many bad reviews. After using the juicer several times, I think the best way to avoid a mess on the counter is by having the drain switch in the off position while juicing, then draining the reservoir after squeezing each piece of citris. This way if the juicer moves away for the glass during juicing, the juice will not go all over the counter.Cleanup is not a big deal. You rinse two pices of plastic.No doubt there are some design flaws like the small juice spout and the counterweight issue, but overall I still think the juicer is a decent value.",1

They do a somewhat reasonable job of reducing airplane/train noise, but the audio quality is pretty bad (unless you listen to everything at low volume and your musical selection has a low dynamic range.) With the volume set loud enough to hear the soft passages, the loud passages are totally distorted. And the double wires coming from the control box to the earpieces just adds to what is already a tangled mess with almost all earphones.

After the movie, Dad drove the route of the Santa Monica portion of the car chase(yes, there really was a ""Big W"").Just finished watching the movie on Turner TV. The narrator came on after the movie and said that THE ORIGINAL WAS 5 HOURS long(Just too much ""good stuff"").

3153,"Start of a journey: I bought this DVD because I really like Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel as actors. I had loved Magimel's intense presence in ""Le roi danse"" and his versatility in more modern tales. I was also curious to see their acting under the influence of their personal love life story starting during this shooting. Although benoit Magimel is great, I don't think he has been used at the height of his talent in this movie. Juliette Binoche gives more of herself and the photography and camera presence help capturing her intense acting. I found the story line too long. I would also have loved to see more historical research shown either in the movie or on the extras. But I still liked it for its classic touch and beautiful decor, and of course the acting and story.",1

3156,"not my kind of mystery: I prefer books where the language does not call attention to itself. Chabon does use eloquent phrases, but they bog down the story.",0
3157,Awful!: This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I probably skimmed through most of the middle chapters. My main issue is tha the female lead character is so completely unlikeable that I was hoping that her abusive father would smack the crap out of her! The fact that she ends up with ANYONE at the end of this book is a great injustice. She is awful! Skip this book and read ANYTHING else instead!,0
3158,"Maybe the best I've found: This may be the best Oracle book I've found so far.A lot of books seem to give canned explanations of how oracle works - geared towards rote memorization as opposed to understanding. This book does a great job of taking the next step.For example, The detail with which the author goes through the process of how updating a row actually works in an Oracle database was tremendous. His explanation of how a select statement could actually cause a row to be marked as committed ( i.e. a read causes a write ) was great.I've only been a DBA (or pseudo-DBA) for about 6 months now, so I'm certainly no expert in this area. Yet I found all of his explanations very clear and easy to understand.If you're looking for a new Oracle book, get this one.",1
3159,"nothing new: Is this it? Is the appropriately named debut Album from the strokes. Appropriate, because after all the hype you would have expected something a bit more invigorating really.Look up television, Iggy pop, gang of four, Richard Hell and the velevet underground because the strokes rip off all of the afore mentioned bands while adding a bit more production to make it more accessible to today's music consumer.How can any self respecting punk rock band form after meeting at boarding school in Switzerland? Punk rock and wealth just don't make sense and the bands mentioned earlier thrived on being outsiders and creating music that came from the pain and suffering experienced as a result. No, the strokes are punk rock for the new millennium. A well packaged, well produced group that will sell millions but will never be as good as the original.",0

While those who are only familiar with his later works would see the trade paper back as crude and not well practiced, others will definately relish in all the history it has to offer. The later comics do hint at what is contained in the earlier issues, but it is best to read it here and get all the details in full black and white. Further, it is always enjoyable to see where a favorite comic started and how it has evolved to what it is today. That is probablly what makes this book most enjoyable.",1
3166,"The sinner and the saint on stage together: This is a profound tribute to one of the masters of 20th century poetry and contemporary music. From Montreal to NYC, Cohen's legacy, poetry, and art are depicted in a series of old photos, movies and performances by Leonard Cohen. Contributing performers, including Rufus and Martha Wainright, Antony, Nick Cates, Perla Batalla, Julie Christensen, U-2, et.al., interpreted Cohen's songs so well that in some instances, they brought us to tears. The ubiquitous backdrop of the bawdy Slipper Room in NYC added an unexpected even self-deprecating contrast to a man who is an ordained Zen Buddhist monk possibly evoking the lessons in the story of Siddhartha. Nick Cates' Vagas lounge act rendition of ""I'm Your Man"" opening the piece contrasts to Leonard Cohens' ""Tower of Song"" with U-2 at the end underlining the duality of spirit prevalent throughout the documentary. Get the DVD and the soundtrack CD. It's that good.",1
3167,"Thorough, but uncolored: Huber has assembled a synopsis of audio recording, which is great for the uninitiated, but I find that the book, while definitely at home in my music recording library, is not opinionated enough to be more than a starting reference. There is a decided lack of opinion on recording issues that often polarize music recording professionals. By being all things to everyone, this book is simply a starting point, albeit an excellent one, well laid out and with chapters that progress in logical order. If you seek pros and cons on recording techniques, you may find some here, as well as a generalization of what is available.",1

I tried to get her some help, but she cited this book and said 'He is my head he has the right to do that.' She was saved by her loving parents who got her away from the creep. i think if she had not been reading this garbage, she would not have lost years of her life to that man.

The reason I bought a hub was to, well, hub things. I had enough USB devices to merit it, and after installation, I thought my troubles were over. No more plugging and unplugging. My bad. Each of the 4 ports had it's own personality. One didn't like the tablet, but loved the SmartMedia reader. It was ambivalent towards the scanner. Another happily took the visor but shunned the scanner.Getting each peripheral to work together at the same time was impossible.

His hope was that I would share this find with my book group; I truthfully thought it would be 'Tom Dooley Goes to the Mountains.' Was I ever wrong! I read this slim novel in one day; I could not put it down! Every chapter brought a new surprising twist or emotion. This is true literary fiction, touching many genres: mystery, romance, travel, humor, social commentary, suspense. Suffice to say that this doctor wasn't a typical missionary and her little corner of these mystical mountains housed characters that will engender interest, empathy, disgust, and tenderness in many readers. This first time author takes his readers on an emotion packed ride with many curves and twists, just like the roads to the top of the Himalayas.",1

He then wastes 20 pages describing a back tracking parser. Lastly he mentions LL(k) grammars but doesn't make the connection to recursive descent parsers.There is no excuse for this shoddiness.

If I had her weapons, I'd be using them non-stop and her she is only using them, if not just one of her blades for a very short time. It's mostly just shootings and some blood here and there. I didn't care for any of the characters or plot. Bloodrayne is a bad ass videogame and Rayne is mighty fine so it's sad when the films stink. I dunno why Uwe Boll sucks at directing and hasn't discovered it yet. I hope they remake Bloodrayne into the gory, nasty, sexy film it's suppose to be. I respect Uwe Boll for all his films and work but he really needs to try harder so he can make a movie that can earn more than a 2 star rating.",0

The top fits great but it shows quite a bit of your belly, which I didn't like since I still have a bit of extra weight leftover from my pregnancy. The skirt part was a bit too big/too loose for me. Since the top was a little too short on me, I pulled the skirt over my belly to cover it up and tied the sash around my waist like in the stock photo and it worked out quite well. It helped keep the too big skirt on and also helped hide my belly more.The material the costume is made out of produces a lot of static so you definitely want to take care of that before the big night out.

3225,"Hey this music DOES take a Mozart man.: Hey dude, you may not be a mozart, but it sure does take a lot of skill to play hardcore metal like slipknot man. This band is what Korn and Limp Bizkit tried to be man. First off, to generate the deep bass tones that slipknot makes, you must be playing a 7stringer or a sub sonic 5 stringer, most likely slipknot are using 7stringers. And they are playing at EXTREMEMELY fast speeds, now playing a seven stringer is harder that a normal guitar, but playing it as fast as they do now THAT takes serious skill man. Also the drummer in this band is awesome, he hits some serious high speeds as in punk rawk. Thats why this stuf sounds so awesome, its the speed of punk rawk, mixed with the tones of hardcore metal. Dont forget the singing/screaming, it takes a lot of lung and skill to maintain that volume. Maybe you should give these guys more credit, after all Mozart couldnt have done what slipknot has.",1

This is not only because of the wondrous authorship and illustration, but because my family were close friends with the author (God rest her soul). Her home was full of little carved mushmen and mushrooms; what a majical place. This is a wonderful read with many miniature adventures that will transport any adult back to childhood innocence, and so much plausibility (I tried to make my own mushmen when I was little).",1

It was great until the chair didn't swivel one day. When we took it apart we found out it was because the rubber liner in the ball-bearing mechanism is cheaply made and comes out. The ball-bearing mechanism is what makes it swivel - without it, you have a wobbly glider. Our problem now is trying to get in touch with Jardine so we can replace the ball-bearing mechanism. Easier said than done. We've been searching for 5 months and we're SOL on this one. Bummer because the chair is comfortalbe, beautiful and is something you want to keep for years and years.",0
3241,"Caution before buying Tensor Products: I can not recommend any Tensor or Catalina lighting product due to their horrendous customer service!

This book might be useful only if you already know this stuff and using it for reviewing.- No solutions (not even to selected problems) and just few insufficient examples inside the chapters.- No summaries and no prefaces: as you read, you never know where the author is going- and in the end of a chapter(which are too long) you alreay can't remember what you've read.- Conceptual parts are either oversimplified, explained ambiguously or simply omitted- Lots of equations/formulas but the author doesn't help in making them more intuitive or meaningful; also derivations are far from the best- Even the logical order and organization of contents is confusing",0

But the temperature is definitely off by at least 10 degrees. The clip on the side for holding the thermometer secure is cheap and does nothing. It's not sealed properly, so you get fogging inside and it gets so bad you can't even read what the temperature is. You can't even wash these by hand, because they fill with water!

I already know why DC did this book, to clean up their continuity. They also had to kill off a few major characters so it would be ""eventful."" The story is highly overrated, as are most stories now-a-days by ""acclaimed"" writers. But, I'm a sucker for George Perez art, so I did not really have a choice. Same goes for Byrne, Zeck, and Bright. No matter who writes the stuff they draw, I'll buy it. Too bad Bright and Zeck don't do more stuff and Byrne doesn't do more than one book. I have almost all their DC and Marvel stuff.",0
3261,Basic statistical concepts 4th ed.: The book is fine with excellent examples and illustrations. I like its conversational tone.Shipping from the vendor took 28 days.

3263,"preachy and unoriginal: I have to say I was expecting a lot more from this book. The fact that Coelho basically lifted his plot wholesale from Durrenmatt's play ""The Visit"" was disappointing. At least he does acknowledge it in the beginning, but this doesn't change the fact that, having read Durrenmatt's play first, Coelho didn't really accomplish anything Duerrenmatt didn't already do, in a much less preachy and more innovative way. The characters are stick figures which get pushed around and serve as excuses for long-winded passages on the problem of good and evil, passages which read more like watered down mass-market self-help than a novel. There's no character development to speak of, and the ""stranger comes to idyllic middle-of-nowhere town and shakes things up"" plot-line has been done, oh, a few times I think. If you find the content or theme interesting, then just go read Durrenmatt's ""The Visit"" or see it performed somewhere. College students always love to do it. Skip this book.",0

3268,"Don't fire your masseuse: Consumer opinions will vary on an item such as this, but you should know the following before ordering:1. The ""massage"" comes from 2 buzzing vibrators implanted in the pad, each the size of a thick silver dollar. You're definitely conscious of these 2 isolated points and of trying to position at least one of them next to the body area to be treated.2. The power supply is fairly massive and heavy. No doubt it will cover up 3 outlets on your wall plate or power strip.3. The pad, like others I've tried, doesn't get very warm, thanks to a built-in safety regulator.4. The velcro straps might be useful if you're able to wear the pad; otherwise, they quickly get in the way. Also, the detachable electrical cord has a tendency to detach itself.5. The price is about half that of a single massage administered by a professional. Is it worth it? I'm beginning to think maybe not.",0

3274,"JUST ONE OF MANY IN THIS GENRE--UNREMARKABLE: After finishing Reaper, I think you'll conclude that this is just one of so many books now in the medical/thriller category. Unlike the good ones, however, this book seems so formulaic that it tires easily and can't give you much thrills or excitement. The plot has some interesting aspects to it, although I found it a bit too far-fetched. The charactes in the book were so predictable and common that they must have been borrowed from other novels or TV shows. Author could have been more creative in that regard. The seemngly endless climax left little satisfaction and I agree with other reviewers who felt that somehow, the author changed his slant in the middle of the book to de-emphasize the virus and suddently go after something else that was more interesting.",0
3275,"Thumbs up for biblical feminism!: Anita Diamamt has opened up a whole new world with this, her first novel. She has captured not only a time and place, but a feeling of unity among women that is lacking in the modern world.

This is, all in all, one tremendous read.",1

The sounds are muffled and not very loud. There are these tiny little STICKERS showing where the animal is supposed to go. My next complaint is that the silo keeps falling off. I am however giving it 2 stars (instead of 1) because my son does like opening and closing the doors and sliding the chicken around.",0
3277,"Bad writing, good story: This book is very frustrating to read. The writing is horrible - the dialog is so unrealistic it's amusing, the descriptions are clinical and full of ""I'll use obscure words to make you think I'm smart"" language, and the characters are flat and annoying. So why read it? It's a really good story, especially if you're interested in the topic of psychotropic medication. Cook's negative opinion of the drugs comes through loud and clear, but it doesn't spoil the premise. The addition of the link to the Salem Witch Trials adds an extra layer of interest. (Although if he referred to it as ""the affair"" or ""the ordeal"" one more time, I was going to send him a thesaurus.) It's worth reading just for the story if you can put up with the bad writing.",0

I don't like, ""Sleeping With An Angel"" because there are explicit lyrics in it and I don't like explicit lyrics in music, but the rest of it is really fine. ""Operator"" is an extreemly silly song about aliens coming down to save Earth, (and I mean that as a Compliment!), but I like it anyway. Among my favrite songs are, ""Operator,"" ""Come and Get Your Love,"" and, ""Run Away,"" but there other songs, too. I reccommend this album to you.

Absolutely nothing about The Family Guy is even remotely original and mostly it's just mildly funny. What's even worse is that Seth MacFarlane sunk even lower with his American Dad show which is even more redundant than The Family Guy. Even worse is this movie is even less funny than most actual Family Guy episodes. Spend your money elsewhere. Go get Skinny Puppy's new Greater Wrong of the Right live DVD.

The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the 1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in 1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book.",1

There is no plot, it goes from one thing to another with no explanation. Unless you don't know a good movie from a bad one, don't get this. The ""comedy"" in it is so repeatative. He fought the mini version for it seemed like 10 minutes and he fought the deadites in the well for another half hour. The phrase it's so bad it's good don't even apply.

I was waiting for Willis' head to appear over the wedding scene nodding in approval. I literally felt queasy after this bomb. The sad thing? Some people actually liked it!!!

At other parts, the writer tried to show that he is quoting from other people as if every person who wrote a book is worthy of quoting. All the quotations are from the missionaries living in Turkey. Given that Turkey was considered to be ""the others"" in the Christian world, you can not expects the missionaries to be fair in their explanations...But if you read the book with this in mind, actually the personal explanations of the sultans are fun to read. I learned some personal details about Abdul Hamid which I did not know for example.But I would not suggest this book as a means to get historical information.",0

All of those they all stand as great dance records (with the exception SM), but this one stands as a great pop album that even non-ska fans can appreciate because of it's strong melodies and extremly well-written (not just for the genre, but period.) lyrics. Anyone who can put this beside the new catch 22 is and idiot because this was a completly different band, one who actually wrote good songs. Tomas picked up where he left off with Streetlight Manifesto, so for anyone who loves this album should follow them as well.",1

3322,"Great lens, just treat with extreme care: Until I got the 50mm f1.4 as a gift, this was my favorite and most-used lens. I found that shooting with a really fast lens like this takes some getting used to as it is very easy to not perfectly focus on exactly what you want as the DOF is so very shallow, but this is a great lens. The fact that it is so cheap is telling though. It takes great images, but this is not a lens you can be at all careless with. You have to be careful with all lenses, but in all the time I have been doing photography (20+ years) I've never had a lens as fragile as this one. The first one I had fell off a low table onto a rug and it was destroyed. The second one was pulled out of a camera bag by a pet and rolled a few feet across the floor and it was also dead.If you want a fast, sharp lens and don't want to or can't spend a lot of cash, buy this lens. Just treat it as though it were a Ming vase.",1

3325,"Idiotic: As I read others' reviews, I was thinking ""Did I watch the same movie?"" At that instant, I saw a reviewer who asked the same question.I'm surprised this movie is getting so many good reviews. I thought it was moronic. Most of the characters are incompetant idiots who are overdrawn and overacted. They were the type of characters I would expect to find in a movie for 5-to-7-year-olds. However, there is so much sexual innuendo in this movie that it can't possibly be meant for that age range. Essentially, it was a bunch of silly, irritating characters trying to express adult themes. It just didn't work.To be fair, maybe it got better further in, but I doubt it. I don't think I made it past the first DVD. I donated the whole set to a rummage sale. What a waste of money.",0

However,I did see this show and it shows Genesis on the cross-road of two era. The shows before this one are much more progressive and symphonic and this show tends to show the commercial side Genesis is going to and led them eventualy to this drag of an album:Calling All Stations. This show is still a good show and I enjoyed it very much. The sound and vision is perfect but, looking back in hindsight, it is one of their last great prog.rock shows they did. After this show the tendecy to slip into commercial suicide is evident.",1
3328,"Imaginitive and Epic: Mystic Warrior is an excellent story about three worlds that were actually the same world. The intricate plot follows the fortunes of an avatar on each of the three worlds, tying them together in a magical convergence where they learn to master the powers that connect the three worlds. As politics, war, and intrigue engulf the heroes, they must let go of all they think they understand about their world or be swept under by the tide of advancing magic.Mystic Warrior is a deep, fascinating story set on interesting worlds. The plotting is intricate and the politics are real. I can see why many people don't get this story. There are layers to it that defy a casual reading. It may be going a bit far to say this is the next Tolkien or Jorden, but it has that epic feel to it.Read and enjoy.",1

It worked fine in the beginning, but quickly deteriorated to the point where the battery barely lasted long enough to vacuum a room. The combination of the Swiffer cloth and suction did work nicely together to pick up dust and cat hair, but it took so long to recharge that it became virtually useless in no time at all and I went back to sweeping the floors. It might be adequate for short spot cleaning, but for that a dust buster (IMHO) does a better job.",0

Windows handles the parallel port kinda funny and this code is for direct access (which Windows doesn't like). This means you can't run the code in a DOS window.

3346,"reads like a Lifetime movie; bad: I got through about 15% of this book before putting it down. I love Nelson DeMille's John Corey books, but most everything else I've tried of his reads like a bad Lifetime movie. (Which is to say, any Lifetime movie!)His antagonist, Cliff Baxter, is a stereotypical evil bully chief of police in a small town. He lords over everyone, including his wife, who makes a half-hearted attempt to kill him early on. Ironically, her former lover, Keith Landry, moves back to town from his career as a national intelligence officer. He still has feelings for her, although he knows she's married. Think Keith and Cliff will do battle later on? I'm assuming so, but I'm not sticking around to find out.DeMille seems more interested in describing every acre of Spencerville and its politics than in telling a good story. Which is unfortunate, because most of the Cory novels (except ""Up Country"") are great.",0

3348,"Whose Story is this?: The title of the novel ""Lisey's Story"" is a misnomer. This is a tortured rendering of King's own nightmarish fantasies (not his first). The novel primarily is the recollection of the horrible childhood of Lisey's husband, the rest is padding. Lisey is just the sounding board. Mr. King once again is trying to scare the reader. At one point, the author uses an actual news story of ""Ralph -- a lost dog's amazing return home"", to justify the fiction writer's prerogative to invent just about anything. So, Mr. King mixes fantasy and reality, but not very successfully. The novel is much too long and repetitious. It was a chore to get through it.",0

The only part that were worth paying for are the interviews and demonstrations.",0
3353,"Good, but not the greatest: While it's not bad by any means, this score relies a little too much on synthesisers to be a truly great score.It works well in the movie itself, but as a CD it isn't as atmospheric as it could be, and the synthesised nature of the music detracts from it.You may come to this soundtrack as a fan of either Angelo Badalamenti or A Nightmare On Elm Street.Either way, you can find better work; Twin Peaks or A Nightmare 1 are both better.Highlights include the opening tack ('Opening'), and Taryn's Deepest Fear, a jazz / rock influenced number played to highlight her life on the streets.It's good for a collector, but not worth the $60 price tags it attracts (I paid a lot less, and am glad I did).",1

3366,"Inchoate humor...: This was the last Sedaris book I read, and I guess I was just spoiled by his other works. Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.His fictional offerings are a bit useless. The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality. When this translates to fiction it loses its validity. There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism. Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction.

Apparently the guide was written way before the game was finished, so some things just don't add up, somethings don't even appear in the game and some things are completely missing. I hate to say this but don't waste your money. If you're really stuck, you're much better off hitting the various tomb raider BB's on the web. Much more helpful!",0

3374,"Best if You Wish to Carry: This book is the best I've read on how to carry and use a handgun for protection. (At home, lock yourself in your room, dial 911 and use a shotgun!) The material offered is based on the realities of a violent, surprise confrontation, not target shooting and practical handgun competitions. Good pointers on how to drill for instinctive, rapid fire use of the handgun. Also, included are good, general guidelines for setting up a training range for law enforcement and military personnel. Well worth the price!",1
3375,"Too much for one singer: Enchantment is really a terrific compilation of songs. It would have been a lot better, however, if they had left it as an original compilation rather than having a single singer trying to do them all. Charlotte Church does O.K. on some of these, like Carrickfergus and The Little Horses. However, I think she went way out of her league when she attempted Papa Can You Hear Me and Somewhere. Some songs and some singers are just not made to be covered. Also, her duet with Josh Groban on The Prayer suggests that she is a few years away from attempting duets with dynamic singers, the caliber of Groban.Some may find this CD worth purchasing simply because of the unique song combination presented. Charlotte Church fans may also like her covers here. I don't think, however, that mainstream people into these genres will want to purchase this. Charlotte spread herself just a little too thin on this one.",0
3376,"RAG RUG INSPIRATIONS by Juliet Bawden: For several years I have been collecting books about rag rugs. Finally, I've found one I'll read over and over again.This book is aptly named. It is truly a book of inspiration, featuring creative designs by a variety of artists. Indeed worthy of a place in the rag rug library. With help from the many wonderful color photos featured, you'll find there is no boundary, no limit to the creativity when making a rag rug.Several methods are shown, including braided, prodded, hooked and more.I highly advise adding this one to your collection.",1

3379,"Really Well Made: I've had this griddle for several months now. It's heavy and really well made. I love that it has a griddle on one side and a grill on the other. It comes already seasoned and is easy to clean, just follow the directions. No soap, hot water and a brush. The reason I'm giving it a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating is that it doesn't heat evenly on my stovetop. I have two large gas burners that I put it over, and the middle of it never gets quite as hot as the ends, so I have to let whatever I'm grilling cook longer if it's in the middle spot. Not a big deal, but with my burners the way that they are, I was expecting it to heat more evenly. It's a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.",1

I read it in six hours flat (finished it at three in the morning, no less), and I recommend you do the same if you buy the book--read it through non-stop the first time, then read it again. You'll discover his writing technique is amazing the second time around. And you start to really understand the characters the second time around as well. One of my favorite books.

In this ""translation"" of the Book of Going Forth By Day (the original Egyptian name for the Book of the Dead) Ellis sings the world into existence and exposes the very depths of my soul like no other writer ever has. It is not a literal translation, but more of a contemporary reflection of what the various chapters mean, a very poetic, smoothly flowing meditation on ""Becoming Osiris"" and living life like the gods we are. If you've ever been interested in Egyptian thought or mythology, you will love this book!I am Osiris. I walk between the two worlds. I am the maker of myths. I remember all that was and what will be. I am eternal, existing for the millions of years. When you see the sun, remember me, remember your Self.",1
3385,"Danger: Coffee Sludge: I was beside myself with joy when this arrived at my home; I'm a serious coffee-drinker and have been limping around on a 4-cup Mr Coffee for some time. For the price, I figured it would be like magic, but as it turns out it's just another Earthly appliance. My main beef with this product is that steam from the brewing process is trapped in the chamber with the super-finely ground coffee. The entire inside of the machine gets coated with a muddy coffee-sludge after just one use. Also, I find whole beans ""glued"" to the lid of the grinder, which is a tragic waste in my opinion.Aside from the goo, however, the coffee is delicious (I especially like the charcoal filter for the water reservoir - fancy!) and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for a nice long time without burning it up.",1

I have yet to find an screenplay this man has done that doesn't meet with my approval. Claire Foy makes a moving debut and Matthew MacFayden was tremendous as Arthur. If you are looking for a downright moving, mysterious, romantic, and entertaining period drama you'll find it in Little Dorrit.",1

But if you have several cd's, you could forget about this poor release, the package is very cheaply put together. Even the song selection could be better.

3399,"boring, wordy, and dense...definite thumbs down: If your goal is to learn the effect globalization has on the state, society, and politics in general this book provides alot of information but it presented in a way that will put you to sleep.Instead of reading the chapters I would recommend going straight to the tables and grids provided because the author does not do a good job of getting to the point. I also found that the grids and tables were a good source of what each chapter actually summed up.I would, however, have to credit the authors for doing a thorough job of covering the various aspects of globalization- from patterns of global finance to global trade and markets to military globalization. Best chapter is the one that deals with migration-otherwise don't bother with this book- you would probably be better of with another book that covers globalization.",0
3400,"Oddball child's tale: This movie is just weird, not scary, and pretty boring. It is almost like a weirded up story of little red riding hood being chased by a vampire and her little demons.

Gave it 2 stars basically for its originality for 1975 standards.",0

All it is about, is this CEO presenting his ""theories"" to a group of people, using awful powerpoint slides crammed with words and making all the classic mistakes of presentation (reading from inside the slides etc). What's even worse, is that he's being intentionally vague (to an extreme extent), introducing terms and theories without really explaining anything (just mentioning them) and bringing up examples that he has complete lack of knowledge about. Most of his statements are at least funny (e.g. ""When a company grows it needs to constantly change, because if it doesn't change it remains the same, it's very simple"").Well, at least this supposed CEO is using some smart sales promotion techniques by selling his DVDs by pretending to be some unrelated vendor and offering a used copy to seem like a bargain (which was actually new).",0

I had trouble getting it since it is out of print but I finally got a copy. I took off work to read it. Although it satisfied my desire to know what happend to Peekay it was substandard compared to TPOO. I would've prefered a paragraph synopsis describing what happened to the principles at the end of TPOO to Tandia. It was poorly written and did not have the storytelling feel of TPOO. Characters were underdeveloped and you didn't feel like you knew Peekay as in TPOO. They also changed Morrie's name and never explained WHY! It was a long book and would've been longer if it had been done right. As much as dreamed of a TPOO sequel, I think I would've preffered to go on not knowing than read Tandia.",0
3413,"Works great!: I ordered the Genie GER-2 Garage Door Emergency Release Kit because the only way to access my garage is by using the garage door opener, which leaves me in dire straits if the garage door opener breaks, power outage, GFI failure, etc.Installation was simple - as it turned out, the garage door already had what I think was the exact same emergency release (looked exactly the same, just older and I had no key for that one), so it was just a matter of removing all the old parts and installing the new one in the existing opening.Using the release is easy, just turn the key, pull out the cylinder, give the cable a yank, and lift up on the door. The only trick with mine is that the top part of the door sticks a little, so you have to manually push on it to get it past that point, but that has nothing to do with the release mechanism.The kit was relatively inexpensive, and I feel that this is very good insurance for the next time the garage door opener fails.",1
3414,"unappealing and harsh: A friend of mine at work bought this CD after listening to the intro and intermission on REanimation. Boy were we surprised to hear this CD.

3415,"very BLAND: This cd has a few songs that rock to some degree, but after the first few songs, it turns to mediocrity. The songs don't stand apart in too many ways, and the first few songs on the album set you up for a big disapointment 1/2 way through the album, as they simply lost all desire to rock.They definately are NOT industrial, as some reviews have stated. True, they have some electronic elements, but that does not an industrial band make.Now I didn't go in thinking they were an industrial band, and wasn't mad because they weren't. I could care less. Good music comes in many packages, and this band is not it.If you are looking to ""rock out"", this is not the place to be. If you like the heavy guitar, stay away.However, if you are looking for simple music mixed with decent vocals and mediocre lyrics, give them a try.",0
3416,"Weak horror novel: This is the second novel I have read by Little. I read University first and thought it to be a good read, a little riduculous at times. But the horror was constant and good. The Town, however, was WEAK and boring. There were a few moments here and there of some good horror. Just when it got ""good"" it sank back down into a slump of boring reading. Waiting and waiting for another exciting moment. There was a very disturbing fantasy plot and ONE shocking moment, to me anyway, involving Sasha at the end. I just did not see it coming. The Town was just way too ridiculous, Jedushka Mevedushka? That was really the explanation for all of this??!! What a let down. Seemed a little too silly for me to buy, especially for an adult horror novel. There was also hardly any blood or gore. I am, however, not giving up on Little yet.

3418,"Foreword by Prof. Simon Wessely- 'nuff said: Prof. Goldenberg is a smart doctor, but unfortunately, like many others, he has had the wool pulled over his eyes by Prof. Wessely, Barsky and other insurance lobbyists trained as psychiatrists and posing as scientists. Prof. Goldenberg explicitly states that there is a biological basis for ME (""CFS""), Fibromyalgia and IBS (p.74), but almost in the same breath (p. 73) he states they have no documented biological basis. The first statement is the true one, btw. He also attributes far too much weight to emotional perpetuation (and it seems causation) in these diseases. He is part way there to understanding these diseases, which is far further along than the vast majority of physicians. I would ask him to go the final mile in trying to understand these physical diseases. I would be more than happy to discuss this with the author.

3431,Ripping LPs for my IPod: I got this a couple of weeks back. The s/w installed very easily and despite no documentation it is pretty easy to use. The only catch for me was that on my initial recordings the playback was great but when I replayed the recordings they were terrible. Windows had the Audio recording source as my Webcam and what was recorded was the sound coming out of the speakers being picked up by the Webcam. Once that was corrected via Windows Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Audio tab -> Sound Recording (Default Device) the recordings were great. I haven't even bothered running any filters to take out the hiss yet as it is pretty insignificant.You have to set the input recording level before starting to record but that is a minor setup that will avoid problems later.The turntable itself is simple to set up and use. Not the greatest turntable ever but at the price it is a complete steal.I now get to listen to all my old albums on my IPod and am delighted with the purchase.,1

The box and pen LOOK completely different, and had been squished and both ends were open. The pens themselves didn't write and were coated with dust. What... even?

3452,"Documentary, not a fiction: This movie accurately depicts the pharmaceutical influence over medical opinion. This movie is the true story of the director and producer who was herself a pharma rep. She took her experience and made it into a story starring Katherine Heigl so it would be more interesting than a straight documentary. As another reviewer commented it does appear to be low budget but its strength is the facts rather than some kind of highly fictionalized and emotional ride for the watcher.Here's an example of an interesting fact--did you know pharma reps get bonuses that may total in the tens of thousands when they get the doctors on their list to prescribe more of a particular drug? That they get free late model cars to drive? All of that is paid for by patients... This is an eye opening based on a true story movie.If you worry about pharma influence over medicine, this movie will be intereting and informative while still being fun and entertaining.",1

3455,"The PAST as judged by the PRESENT: The film takes the anti-Mormon historical accounts of the event as fact. Again, modern Americans use a cinematic event to judge and condemn people of former times with current attitudes. This gives modern Americans the opportunity to feel righteous indignation against other people. YES the event did happen. Did Brigham Young order it or did John D. Lee commit the massacre on his own? Since we can only read what is written by observers of the times we will never know. This will not stop modern bigots who were not there in 1857 from using this film to condemn the Mormon Church of today. Anything to be offended.

Although Iommi is the only original Sabbath member on this album, he does manage to employ ex-Deep Purple/Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes. In turn, Hughes offers a top notch voice (in spite of an ongoing battle with substance abuse) across this LP. Iommis guitar work is brilliant as usual, in this case a vintage 80's metal riff and lead for each track (See In for the Kill,Turn to Stone,Angry Heart,etc.) A must have for Sabbath or Hughes collectors.",1

Catherine Deneuve would have to be one of the 20th Century's finest actresses. Indeed there are no actresses around today who could match her performance in this film.The back drop of both Vietnam, Mayalsia and Geneva are stunning to look at. The use of politics and power of the french colonial rulers and rich landowners is both intriuging and a good lesson in the politics of the time. Everyone should watch Indochine at least once in their life, if for nothing else but to gain a better understanding of Vietnam and to see how beautiful it is.",1

Justin ripped off r&b that has been around for years and some stupid justin fans on this board have the nerve to call him original, it's unbelievable. and they don't realize that by doing that they are discrediting black musicians and songwriters who enhanced the r&b genre, and this album is full of neptunes and timbaland who are also black.

3481,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!: I have to say that these earbuds look great in the package. After my standard iPod earphones stopped working I shopped around for a replacement. I like the in-ear style headphones because they are discreet. These looked great, they were even white.The first thing I noticed after opening them was the odd cord configuration. The cord is split unevenly allowing the cord for one earbud to wrap around the back of your neck to the other ear. The problem is that the cord splits too early leaving a dangling cross section right under your left ear. This tugs on the earbuds which fit horribly.Yes, they look great but they do not fit in my ears whatsoever; I even tried both attachments. At first I just thought that I was unlucky and my ears are shaped weird... but that's not the case. Every review seems to have the same conclusion: they don't fit.I will say that they sound great when I hold them up to my ears... but, don't waste your money.",0

I felt the ending was too quick and forced to really build the suspense necessary to make the book as fascinating as it could have been. Some of the characters were developed partially, but not as far as needed because I wasn't truly concerned about the fate of any of the population. I was actually almost offended by the suggestion that this could hold any sort of light next to King's or Koontz's work. It's a nice brain candy read, but nothing more.

With apologies to EST, so what? Knight has done something valuable: he has staked out the other end of the playing field for Islam and, in doing so, has shown us just how big it really is. There are only two take-home points in this entertaining novel, but they're really good. First, Islam and punk are the same thing - or they used to be, back in the day. Second, America can save Islam by providing the freedom for each Muslim to practice Islam has s/he understands it.

Flattered by his attentions, Viola was nevertheless not amused when he appeared the following morning at her estate, claiming it as his own.So begins No Man's Mistress, a charming and unusual novel by Mary Balogh. It might seem at the beginning a typical Regency romance. But Balogh deftly and delightfully thwarts all of our expectations in this riveting tale. Nothing is at it seems as these two strong characters lock horns in a battle of wills whose stakes, for Viola, are higher than the reader can initially even imagine.Balogh has an entertaining gift for character and dialogue in this fast-paced, intriguing story. All historical romance lovers will thoroughly enjoy the surprising and moving No Man's Mistress.",1

3510,A Magical Flute Concerto: Christopher Rouse is truly a special composer of today. His music has a very distinct flavor that is unique and always interesting.The gem of this CD is definately the Flute Concerto. It is a beautifully written work that utilizes the expressive qualities of the flute. The Flute Concerto is steeped in nostalgia and manages to probe the heart.Carol Wincenc performance of the Flute Concerto is amazing. She performs the concerto with a voice that is quite magical. She really draws the listener in with her expressiveness and alluring tone. It is hard to imagine any other flutist being able to perform this concerto and achieving the same amount of heighten emotion as Wincenc has done. Bravo to Carol Wincenc!!!I hope that this Concerto will climb it's way up to becoming a standard flute concerti of the flute repertoire.,1

They are amazing and the therapists can't believe the difference between the room and when they open the door. I would definitely recommend them for any noisey situation and plan on purchasing another one for my travels.,1

This is not a good representation of what low carb eating is, IMO, compared to Dr. Atkins' other books. This may turn someone off.",0
3514,"Project Pat's first BANGER!: Project Pat's album before he was incarcerated. This is no solo album like the new Mista Don't Play, but it features most of his Hypnotize Mind ""Family"" as he calls them. Such as, Three 6 Mafia and Noreaga. And just other artists such as Krayzie Bone, Lil E and Cash Money Records. Ghetty Green is some tight (...). The real bangers to me are ""Whatever H**"", ""Ballers"", ""Slangin Rocks"" and even more, even though, this album is very hard to find in just a regular CD store, but if you see it. Get it! You'll not be disappointed with all the BANGERS it has on it!",1

3520,"Solid watch: I got this watch as a gift, and I've worn it everyday for about a week.Pro:- Simple, easy to read functional watch.- Does everything well in the product description.- Easy to wear/take off.Con:- The ticking noise is louder than I expected, but this is my first watch in years. I don't really have any other watches to compare this to.- The wrist band ""squeaks"" when I move my hand. The ""squeak"" doesn't occur often enough, and not loud enough to annoy me, but it is noticeable. I'm hoping this will go away as I wear it more.Final remarks:I personally enjoy the simple design, and functionality of this watch. The build seems pretty good, especially for the price, and I'm happy with the product.",1

3522,"Brosnan's Best! But not the best....: Die Another Day, the 20th James Bond Adventure, is by far the best of the Brosnan Bond movies. The action and sensuality put this one over the top. However the movie felt more like a forced replay of all of Bond's Adventures. The Only departure from the norm was the gritty techno music in the beginning sequences when Bond is being tortured, played by Madonna. As the flim progresses you start to see smilarities from all the other Bond films.The Belt that Jinx Is Wearing: Dr. NoThe Space sequence: MoonrakerThe Villian: The Living Daylights and Diamonds Are ForeverThe Opening sequence: The Living DaylightsThe Laser Sequence: GoldfingerIf you're in the mood for a good action movie see this movie.

3523,"The Last Hero: I was pleasently suprised with this one. It was one of the few Discworld books that I had not yet read, so I forked over the $14 for a copy. Once I got it, I realized that $14 wasn't a bad deal.Every other page had an illustration, the paper was thick and glossy, and the book was more in the form factor of a conversation piece for your coffee table than a novel, to say nothing of the story, which was of course wonderful.",1
3524,"This is an excellent table.: I have never reviewed a product before on Amazon, but this table deserves attention. Before I bought this table, I did quite a bit of research. It also had to be stored our garage. Our garage holds two cars, storage cabinets and a work bench so the width of the table folded up was a major consideration. This seemed like the best buy, but I read the other reviews and someone wrote that set up is not easy. Ok, so I knew that and had my husband and a friend put it together on a Sunday afternoon. It really did take about 4 hours total and an electric screw driver is a must. But, I would say it is a wonderful table, it just takes some time to put it together and it takes two people to do it. And fits well into our garage when stored. Pam Brown",0

Quite possibly it would be that I want to hook up with implants and get out of this weak fleshy body. I constantly upgrade my computer. I want to upgrade myself.",1

After seeing the video for ""Evolution Revolution Love"", I was interested enough to pick up a copy of the album. What starts off good, with the trippy ""Excess"", and then ""Evolution Revolution Love"", and the Morcheeba-sounding ""Over Me"", soon winds down to track after track of uninteresting songs. I tried and failed to find any other song that could hold my attention. If you do get this album, be prepared to keep the first three songs in rotation, and ""blow"" past the rest.",0
3529,Used?: These are marked Medela but come in an unmarked plastic baggie. These don't come in the Medela box that they should come in. Might be a way for the seller to save money on shipping. But also could indicate a used product. Sketchy to me.,0

So again of to the mail with my S&H and time as if Toshiba were the only ones that run a business. Out of commission for over a month I recieved another refurbished unit. Now that I am out of my original warranty period of one year they refuse to repair/replace my camera that has another button that has popped off, without an additional $... for another refurbished unit. Why? So the button can pop off again? I think not. I think I'll learn to take my losses.",0

After applying this cloth to my screen all I can say is WOW. It certainly lives up to its name in the title of being high performance and it didnt even leave no single scratch at all. Now the only thing I did taken notice is the edges you might wanna be careful on with the cloth like they appear to surely scratch surfaces and also remeber you wanna shake the dirt and stuff off the cloth all the time. You dont wanna drag it along and have that scratch the surfaces of whatever your wipeing off but overall I say this cloth is worth the 5 dollars and cant beat the shipping rate I have gotten too at being free also. Im regerting just into getting one now and going buy a spare one =),1
3536,"Lyrically lacking catchy pop/rock.: BLUESIDE is the highlight. After that this CD falters due to the fact that this band needs direction. The songs are constructed in a way that halfway through the album they start to really sound the same. The lyrics are teenage notebook meanderings that don't support the guitar pop catchiness that is this act's strong suit. They surely have the right idea, a crisp production with some strong hooky moments (mostly in track 1), but they need to reach down and harness some of the talent that lies deep within. Until then they just seem average.",0
3537,"Heavy Duty: Lightning Audio is no more, but their products live on. If you can get your hands on one of these, I highly recommend it. This thing is huge, heavy duty, and well constructed. The internal capacitors are ceramic, solid state caps. Not the hybrids you see today. The internal resistance is much less than the hybrids and it really performs well on peak notes in my system. No voltage drop, with room to spare for the next heavy bass note. Comes with a big LED display. Again, this thing is HUGE. Make sure you have a lot of room for it. FYI, the two terminal blocks contains two 0 gauge inputs and one 4 gauge input for a total of 3 input/outputs per block. (3 for the positive, 3 for the negative.)",1

He, on numerous occasions in the book, alludes to the fact that his being ""Greek"" has some kind of correlation with the other ""oppressed"" peoples of the world - absurd. Additionally, he seems to be the driving force behind ALL of the successes during his involvement in the Clinton Administration, relegating people like James Carville to a back seat (the opposite seems to be true if you read any of Carvilles works). His bias is clear and not at all masked, which supports the current "" I am not a narrow-minded liberal even though I behave like one"" mentality prevalent in today's network news media. Pass on this book and get one with true insight and analysis.",0

A woman adopts a child who turns out to be the devil; the little boy gets kidnapped for a ransom, but when the kidnappers start dying off the head kidnapper decides the boy should be killed. Turns out, the kidnapper wanted the boy killed anyway.It's called ""Whisper"" because the devil in the little boy whispers to people, compelling them to do crazy things. The movie is quite boring up until it's climax. The climax was great, the storyline twist took me by complete suprise. I can usually figure a story out before it's climax but this twist kind of rocked me....and then it got boring again. In fact the ending was ridiculous!!I'm glad I saw this on tv.

3548,"Great little fan: Fan works pretty well. Its not too loud at all and the clip is nice and sturdy.I took a star off because of the way you turn it on. It is a dial on the back of the motor that you have to turn. While this works great in the upright position of the fan, if you position the fan so it faces directly up, the dial gets moved behind the bracket, making it less convenient to turn on and off. For me I have it positioned so its always in the position that the dial is inconvenient.Not that big of a deal but I found it enough to earn it 4 stars. I'm satisfied with my purchase.",1

I wondered, ""What is this?"" My engineer's mind needed some help in understanding just what it was. I bought Journey Without Distance to find out what A Course in Miracles (ACIM) was all about. I found the account to be credible as well as an enjoyable read. I was not put off by the notion of ""channeled"" material, because I was in the process of learning how to do it myself. I suppose there are many who discount the validity of it. So I became convinced that ACIM is legitimate, and I persevered and subsequently joined a study group to help me adapt to a new way of thinking. It's been over two years since. I want to give credit where it is due. I strongly urge anyone new to ACIM to become familiar with its background. Journey Without Distance is an excellent aid.",1

Proposing a radical and severe thought system that diminishes the human condition is not the answer. And rejecting the ideas set forth in this particular book is certainly not crucifixion.

Tom Morello (guitar), Brad Wilk (drums), and Tim Commeford (bass) rock with unrepentant strength, and Chris Cornell checks his depressive tendencies at the door and - what a concept! - just wails. If there was any doubt before that Cornell's the premier metal vocalist on the planet, the one-two punch of ""Cochise"" and ""Show Me How to Live"" will banish such foolishness from your mind.

Sounding possibly autobiographical, it tells the story of a young man who comes to New York in the early 1970s to become a stage actor. The novel captures the feeling of that era nicely. Especially to those who, like me, lived through and came of age in that decade, I recommend this book for the nostalgia alone. Barnhardt has a great skill with using language, so there's a recommendation also for other writers to learn from his skills (he's a writing teacher, after all). I enjoyed the book.",1

I mean the end when she killed the old bedridden witch was kinda cool and the upstairs attic floor covered with maggots was original but other than that you had this invisible killer going around slashing up girls, I mean you can at least see Jason or the Candyman but this killer in the movie just seems like the keygrip guy or the studio janitor being called into be that ""deranged but unseen killer dude"" and imitate I guess the evil unseen spirit force of the witches. This movie was and I mean this STUPID!... I tried to like this movie but I just couldn't hang.",0

3590,"A waste of time and money: The preponderance of this cassette was filled with the author's own experiences as anecdotes, presumably meant to illustrate to us just how far he has come in his quest of emotional literacy. The entire first side of the cassette and most of the second is filled with irrelevant information which does nothing to assist the listener on how to apply any such lessons to one's own life or to assist others in achieving emotional literacy. While the author is very impressed with himself, I am not at all impressed. This cassette was quite a disappointment. I certainly cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone who is truly interested in accomplishing anything other than wasting his/her time and money. As of this writing, this cassette has encountered my ""circular file.""",0

We spent half an hour on the first two steps in the instructions. AND FAILED. And we are two college graduates who work out.

Very few on board shots at racing speed. The ""PITS"" sections isn't about pit activity during a race, but about who is watching the monitors and milling around the pits before and during a race.

What a life it was!The stories and captions that go along with the hundreds of photos are fun and informative. It's like history with wit and verve.

However, the professor I had did an excellent job of taking a poorly written, overly complex text and turning the material into easy to understand concepts. The only redeeming factor in this text is the abundance of graphs, maps, etc. Those we used very extensively in class and they did help to clarify the material. Of course, if your professor chooses this text for your class, you need to purchase it. Overall I'm glad I did purchase the text because the graphs, maps, etc were helpful and also required for reference in several exercises we did in this class. I'm also glad to be able to sell it back.",0
3622,"Shakespeare Would Have Died: Casting Mel Gibson as the complicated Hamlet was a huge mistake. I felt as if he didn't even understand the words coming out of his mouth. Also, the long play was cut in half, leaving a lot missing. Glenn Close was way too young to be cast as Mel's mother; she's not even 10 years older than him, and Zefferelli didn't even bother to put ageing makeup on her. I think Glenn Close is a fine actress, but she only did a mediocre job in this mediocre movie. The messy and grainy cinematography never let me forget that I was watching a movie, instead of sucking me into the story. The Kenneth Branagh version is infinitely better.",0

3626,"GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60 is better: I started working out a year ago, starting with GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60. It's much lower cholesterol and fat than Syntha-6. I lost 5 lb of fat and gained back 9 lb of muscle in 6 months with Wheybolic Extreme. Healing time was always less than 24 hours. It tasted like a rich smooth milkshake.Then I switched to BSN Syntha-6 because it was almost half the price of Wheybolic and I was recommended it by a huge bodybuilder. The mochaccino flavor is pretty good, but is chaulkier than Wheybolic. It's not a perfect milkshake consistency. Recovery time was almost extended to 3 days - that's like as if I wasn't taking any protein at all. I also have not gained a single pound in the the past 3 months with Syntha-6. It just doesn't work.I also looked up Consumer Reports 2010 on protein powders. Syntha-6 contains many small, but legal, doses of poisonous metals. Wheybolic does not.

3628,"Fascinating and Life Changing: I can't believe that this book is not better known. The implications of it are enormous. It is well written and logically organized and has tons of practical information for ways to more effectively use your brain. Yes, much of it is common sense, but the writer backs it up with evidence I hadn't read before. As a result, I've begun taking fish oil supplements, eating differently, working suduko puzzles and cutting back on alcohol and coffee. If I have one criticism of this book it is that there is almost too much in it. You hardly know where to begin.I think a critic could say that Dr. Amen is self-promotional, and that the book is a long ad for his clinic. But I took this information to be the product of real enthusiasm for his work.While this book can't answer all the mysteries of the brain, and while it can't hope to be a tool for diagnoses, it is well worth the time to read it and think about the beneficial changes you can make.",1

3634,"Not a TRUE Coulter.: I could not be labeled as a ""Fan"" of Catherine Coulter's after reading this book. It was too different from the rest of her books. Too based around the child. Ms. Coulter, I believe, is an adult romance writer. My preference is for the novel to be centered on the two adults and their romance, not a 'perfect' little girl. I was disappointed that Ms. Coulter would write this and I actually feel sorry for anyone who spends their money on The Target. I honestly believe that they would be better off reading the Bride Series or Legacy Series or perhaps The Cove and The Maze. I am not thrilled that I spent money on this book.

First off, it's hard to clean the inside. I previously owend a simple Braun blade grinder that was EASY to clean. Secondly, the grounds sometimes stick to the inside of the plastic hopper, which was never a problem with my old Braun. It causes a mess sometimes. But the main prblem is that I notice no difference whatsoever in the taste of my coffee versus using the old blade grinder.

If they would have made it in the tradition of ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" it could have been better. The photography killed the whole movie.

Most treks are affordably run out of local agencies with guides, so I didn't even bring the book with me on the trail. It is best used for pre-trip planning back home, deciding which treks you want to plan your itinerary around once in country. The LP country guide is really all you'll need.",0

3657,"Good product in overall: I have a low threshold for pain and was able to tolerate this OK from the very first time. It gets easier the more you do it, though. The issues I found with this product is that you may have to do this many times in the same area to completely remove hair and also the number of ingrown hairs that result after using it. Also, I was only able to use it on my legs as other areas prooved to be very painful.",1
3658,"Product Defective--Twice!: Some discs in the first set we ordered were defective--skipping, pixelating, sometimes grinding to a halt. This set was exchanged quickly and without expense on our part by Amazon. The second set also contained discs with the exact same defects. Upon attempting an online return of the second set we discovered that the return time window had closed and read that no return would be allowed. There are 33 discs in this set and it is highly unlikely that one would encounter a defect in, say, disc 30 within the allowed return period. We called Amazon, pointed this fact out, and were granted a full refund on the second set (but watch your credit card statement--only a partial refund was credited until we called customer service to follow up). We would strongly discourage anyone from ordering this set until Amazon states specifically that the defective product has been removed from their stock.",0
3659,"What's marketing go to do with it?: Until I saw her perform last night at the Indigo Girls concert, I had never even heard of Shannon Curfman, let alone been exposed to a record label marketing campaign devoted to her. Hearing her and seeing her though live, I was, quite simply, blown away. This girl is an amazing talent. And not just for a 14 year old, either. She's amazing, period. Her vocal range was unbelievable, her guitar playing brought the house down, and her overall talent puts to shame all the manufacured acts that always seem to be squtting atop the charts. If Melissa Etheridge had acted sooner and chosen Stevie Ray Vaughn as the father of her child, that child would have been Shannon Curfman. She's an extremely talented performer with what I know will be a long, exciting career ahead of her.",1

3662,"Preachy, pretentious, political propaganda: If you like political diatribes disguised as ""fiction"", this book is for you. If you think pro-choice Lesbians are all unsung heroes and pro-life activists are all raving, wife beating control freaks, this book is for you. If you want to slog through hundreds of pages of ""Goodliness is admirable but Godliness is vile"", then this book is for you. If you are an ""openminded"" liberal who believes that perpetuating ugly stereotypes about conservatives is an honorable mission, then you have hit paydirt.If, however, you were expecting a book with interesting characters, intriguing situations and thoughtful contemplation of different ideas and motivations, then skip this and try something else. This book is an insult to serious readers and a 600+ page tribute to smug, self congratulating humanists.Before purchasing, you might want to sleep on it.",0

Target changed it with no questions, this one worked fine, reception is OK were the signal is good, don't expect much out of town.I have found that batteries seem to run down even when it's not on, so if you go a couple of weeks between uses, you will either need take them out or keep a new set handy, not good.As other reviewer have said, it's OK, but your probably better off spending a bit more on a Sony.",0
3664,"Poor showing: I like Steve Coogan, and Rebecca Romijn is easy on the eyes (even if she's made to look 7 feet tall in this movie), but this flick- as promising as it sounded- was just not up to snuff. It was kind of as if they were trying to mix a Guy Ritchie movie with the Sting, but it just didn't work. And even though Steve Coogan is a hilarious comedian, this wasn't funny in the least. Why cast one of the world's best comedians in a dull, half-hearted gangland adventure? Without any laughs, the convoluted plot and implausible romance failed to hold up this lead balloon. Someone give Mr. Coogan some material he can work with!",0

I think David Mack really does justice to the Star Trek thought process, and he spins another great tale here.If you haven't read the entire series in 2007, I would suggest ordering the entire series, or at least the next three books at a time if you like this series. It seems the books are getting somewhat rare, and it takes a month to get the middle of this series. If you want to read one after the other, I would suggest biting the bullet here and ordering at least the first seven (Be Born, Die, Sew, Harvest, Love, Hate, Kill)books so that you can read right into this one. I had to wait for the middle books, that I could only find on Amazon, for about a month, and I was really watching my mailbox after reading the first three. Great series of books for the ST TNG fan.",1
3667,"A real dissappointment at the party: My son saw this cool new toy on t.v. like all the others and wanted it for his 6th birthday. We got it and it was a hit opening up the package until we tried to use it. First of all, I don't know how many people live in a house without trim, so take that into big consideration when you do your research. The hummer was so loud like a leaf blower but would not go up anything. We tried to give it the benefit of the doublt and let it charge over night. The next day, we made sure the wheels were clean, found a good spot without trim on the walls, and gave it a go. It kept falling down, even with assistance, it struggled to go anywhere but on the floor. On the floor, the kids wanted us to turn it off because it was so loud. Another down fall was the remote. It was not easy to steer for my 6 year old or his 11 year old cousin. We had to take it back and I don't recommend it especially for the price.",0
3668,Who stole the ending?: I look forward to the Alex Cross novels. I enjoyed this book until the last couple of chapters. Did Mr. Patterson have a plane to catch? What happened to the ending? Maybe the publishers left it out of my copy of the book?,0
3669,"Warning! Consider the source when looking at this book.: I bought this book as a gift and after reading a bit, wished I had not! The ""wit"" some reviews have mentioned is in very poor taste. I was shocked when I read a mention of St. Joseph that included an old ""joke"" about him that had no place in a book of Saints. I felt confused and betrayed. So I did what I should have done before, I looked at the authors. On the cover (the back I think) was the usual blurb about who wrote the book. I was dismayed to find I'd bought a Saints book by 2 Professed EX-Catholics! If you're looking for something Catholic, consider the source. Ever since that day, I always have.May I suggest Bob & Penny Lord's books? Now those are Catholic!!",0

3675,"Hopeless and lost: One criterion that I have for what is a good read is whether I like or empathize with any of the characters. This story falls down in that area. Each character is almost unrelentingly selfish, desperate, unhappy and without hope or prospect of future happiness--with the possible exception of America--and it is somewhat unrealistic that she stayed with Candido after even the first of their series of misfortunes.The story gets lost and does not quite know how to end--without revealing the ending, I might say that it is unbelievable, unsatisfactory (and feels unfinished).Despite good descriptive passages, I would not recommend it.",0
3676,"A decent burner: I bought this burner expecting a cheap burner that would do the job, but not very well. However, for ($$), this burner does the job phenomenally. The copy of Nero that also comes with it, works well. All in all, this is a (darn) good burner",1

Well, once I got it, I was extreamly disappointed. Mia rambles on and on about how much she misses michale, and on and on about the same four topics. BORING! I couldn't finish it because the plot wasn't going anywhere, and it was mostly rambling. I wouldn't suggust this book to anyone, but I have and will continue to reccomend the other books in the series to others. Will I continue to read the series? Only if Cabot hooks the reader within the first fifty pages, which Princess in Waiting certianly did not.",0
3680,"Not everyone is one size fits all: This book is a very 'one size fits all'. according to the writer, it *appears* she suggests that everyone with a weight issue has these 6 issues and that unless you fix these 6 issues in the way SHE states, you can not be cured. It blames your parents for their lack of 'insert what ever here'. Not everyone has these exact issues and writing a book that reads like a vcr manuel without no real guidance doesnt help I dont feel. I got nothing at all out of the book and was rather put off by her claiming to understand the root of all the problems with overweight people. I dont appreciate the blame being placed on parents. We, ourselves, are responsible for the most part. I dont like the 'know it all' approach. I didnt even get through the entire book before I took it back to the library. It was dull and boring with no real help of HOW to go about doing what she suggests.personal opinion only.",0

3682,Awesome soundtrack!: This is an amazing soundtrack. I love all of the songs on it. For all of you who are disappointed because the two best songs from the movie were not included on your copy of the soundtrack there is good news. The soundtrack has been rereleased and it includes both 'wild summer nights' and 'tender years' on it. Those two songs are by far my favorites from the movie and they are the reason why the soundtrack gets five stars from me. It's great!,1

3685,"One of the Best Books on the James Bond Films from DK: If you are a James Bond fan this book from Dorling Kindersley is nothing less than fantastic. Dorling Kindersley is starting to corner the market on good looking and attractive books. This book is very visually conceived, designed and presented so this book is right up Dorling Kindersley&#65533;s alley. They know how to do it right. Each James Bond film is addressed with an emphasis on its production design (gadgets, sets, etc.). We are given 3 dimensional views of key sets from each film. This is what I really liked about it. This is a great companion book to Sally Hibbon&#65533;s &#65533;The Official James Bond Movie Book&#65533; which was also very beautifully presented. If you love the cinematic world of James Bond this book from Dorling Kindersley is for you. This is a book you thought they never would make, but they did. This book holds a special place in my collection.",1
3686,"An excellent book for the beginners.: It is an excellent book for the beginner; either a CS major or a self-paced learner. As long as you don't forget to concentrate on ""Problem Solving by Abstraction"" rather than trying to write a program in JAVA, this is the place to start. I found ""Simply Scheme"" was a very interesting source for abstract reasoning. Overall, ""Java for Students"" threaded the OOP well throughout the book.",1
3687,"I don't like the format: This isn't what I expected. I expected 4 columns, one for each gospel, with blank spaces where appropriate. Maybe this would've used more paper, but it sure would've been easier to navigate. With *very* close inspection I can see that there is a boldfaced narrative as promised, but it's not especially bold. It's hard to distinguish the boldface from the regular font. And I don't care for the little titles over the various subsections. Maybe a few footnotes or an appendix explaining where/why the gospels differ on various points or why Daniel placed chapters where he did, but all those titles and varying formats really interrupts the reading. It's not at all what I was hoping for, I'm afraid.",0

Even back then, you can taste the magic. If you like U2, you will love this album...For the casual fan, buy it, and see what all the fuss was about...",1

My son is 7 months and when he falls asleep in his carseat his head ends up straight forward chin to chest. I'll give it one more try then it's gonna be returned. Disappointing! Another reason I rated this so low, is the Velcro strap that attaches behind the head was to short. With the strap connected the pillow forces my sons head forward. This product would probably work better in an infant carrier/car seat because it is reclined more. But as for preventing ""floppy head"" in a proper carseat it gets a BIG ZERO!! ALSO I DON""T see how this thing could fit a toddler's head (as seen on packaging). I guess you wouldn't use the strap but then were does the strap go?

Unfortunately, ""Artificial Soldier"" is such a release.Prior to ""Artificial Soldier"", there was ""Epitaph"" and ""Civilization"". ""Epitaph"" seemed like it could have been Disc-2 to ""Implode"". While a good album, it wasn't exciting enough to gardner many listens. ""Civilization"" was a boring and meandering release, that had maybe 3 good songs with the rest being filler. ""Artificial Soldier"" continues this trend.Do yourself a favor, and stick with the previously mentioned FLA albums. They are much better. Start with ""Implode"". That record will change your world. ""Artificial Soldier"" will just remind you how crappy the world is now.",0
3727,"A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful.",1
3728,"Smoothed over, British release: The blues were never meant to be recorded this smoothly. Typical of the Brits to turn a legend into a circus show. A lot of talent on the recording wasted, but the master himself and harp player Carey Bell still manage to come through. Of course, recorded in the early seventies, this album toned down the blues for its day. I recommend ""Hard Again"" produced by Johnny Winter...an excellent blues album with the rough, and easily puts acts like ""Led Zeppelin"" to shame. ""Do it Johnny, Do it!""",1
3729,"My first filter: I bought this filter for my kit 18-55 so that I could prevent the strange flare that occurs when I photograph my kids late-afternoon. I can't compare it to other filters, but it has definitely had a great impact on the overall quality of my photos.",1
3730,"Exciting!: I started reading this at the start of the year, but never got to finish it because it was a library paperback. Read the rest of it now. Loved it! :D",1

3732,"JUNK: I have had mine for quite a while only to have to fight with it in hopes of getting my radio to receive the weak signal. In order to help receive the signal I must put my hand near the left side to keep the worst of the hissing sound away like a poorly tuned radio. If I put my hand on the right side of the P25, as to jump to the next song, it will tend to loose the signal. I tend to avoid taking on the hassle just to listen to my music over the radio. This is one product to avoid even if they gave it away.",0
3733,"major disappointment: It works, just barely, if your source and target are two feet apart.The sound sucks even then. A lot of money wasted. I am very ticked off.Wish I had never ordered it. Don't make same mistake.",0

3735,"Great bra!: I just purchased this bra and love it! It is comfortable when jogging and holds you in with no bounce. It's also great for wearing all day long. I'm going to buy another one. Size up one for the cup like was suggested by another reviewer. I bought a ""B"" and had to return it for a ""C"".",1
3736,No Pressing Instructions???: After I cut out all the pieces for the My Heart Belongs to Chocolate quilt I discovered that there are no pressing instructions for this quilt and it REALLY needs them! One of the main reason I buy patterns is so I don't have to spend time figuring out things like pressing instructions. I won't buy any more books from this author.,0

3738,Crappy product: The umbrella is too heavy and too large when it folds to sit in a messenger size bag. It is relatively modest when it comes to coverage area provided. Mine worked fine for a month or so and then the threadings came off the elbows. Within a day 3 more elbows came off as the brackets disjointed from the cloth. And the cloth slipped from the joints at the end. May be I got a defective piece.I decided to return but they have a clause saying you have to register your product within 30 days of purchase to avail of it. And then you pay 10 $ for shipping and handling and then they will take 4 - 5 weeks to get back to you.Saved myself the trouble and got another one for less. Dissapointed that I spent good money on this. Need a umbrella in Boston though.,0
3739,"The only bibs you'll need: These are fantastic. Forget cloth bibs you need to wash after every use, the flimsy reusable ones that are hard to clean (like the Bumkins or Kushies), soft plastic ones that rip or bend over so the cup part doesn't catch anything (like OneStep Ahead) - these are excellent. We gave all the others away and just need two of these. And my boy's a mess. But they're so easy - you put them on, the hold their shape so catch almost everything, and are super easy to clean up (just a quick rinse). No mess, no piles of dirty bibs to wash, great. We used them for my daughter too. She wasn't nearly such a messy eater - but neat or messy - these bibs work great. Yes, they are stiff, but that's why they hold their shape. They're not uncomfortable though. Both my boy and girl wore them from 6m to 3years without complaints.",1
3740,"Never received order: After waiting a month for the video to arrive, I received the message that it would not be shipped. I was very disappointed as I needed this video to practice for a talent show - our group at school had been using an old VCR tape. We now have a very short amount of time to make other arrangements. This was not a good Amazon experience! I also cannot a rate a product that I never received and I hope that this does not prevent my review from reaching you. Seems that I cannot submit this without a rating - so I'll choose 1 star but know that you may want to allow for this option when reviewing.",0
3741,A good close shave.: This is a quality product and produces a nice close shave. It is also rated high in Consumer Reports.I would purchase it again.,1
3742,"A beautiful voice and spirit, for singing beautiful music: This CD must be close to the best, if not the best, recent addition to my growing collection of Christmas CDs. Jewel's voice has a unique vibrancy which suits it pervectly for traditional Christmas carols. Her renditions of ""O Holy Night"", ""Silent Night"", ""O' Little Town of Bethlehem"", and ""Ave Maria"" are the best examples. On the other hand, she conveys a relaxed and swinging style on ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer. Her inner spirituality is feelingly expressed in her own originals, ""The Face of Love"", and ""Hands"". I hardly consider this a CD to use as background at a party. It's too beautiful to waste on a group not really listening to it. Instead, I recommend it for personal enjoyment and to share with special friends of like mind.",1
3743,"alright, this cd is okay....: I bought this cd thinking it was going to be all Guns n' Roses, and ended hearing different bands. Yes, I know on the package it said who all the songs were by. But I had my sister run into the store for it because I thought it had a parental advisory sticker on. Anyway, it sounds like loud techno stuff. My Michelle is probably one of the better songs on here. Buy if you must, but not the best cd.... Although I like it, haha.",1
3744,"2 Episodes, Including: Mind Your Own Business: ""Mind Your Own Business"" originally aired on 5/26/56. This is the episode where, in part on Ralph's advice, Ed gets fired from his job in the sewer and starts selling irons door-to-door. It does not work out, but he eventually gets his old job back. There is some suspense in the episode as Ed tells Ralph that he is very successful in selling the irons when in reality he is not.",1

It is unstructured and unorganized in it's deliverance of information.It does not give a complete list of common gym exercises, nor a diagram of the human muscle anatomy for reference and application.This book leaves many questions unanswered or vaguely answered.The subject matter jumps around alot, giving tidbits of information as you read through.The author just didn't carry the ball all the way on this one.Luckily enough I found a better book that really outlines it all as well as giving a real periodization structure to create my progressive workout routine.",0
3748,"I expected better....: Man, this dvd is absolutely terrible. I bought it like 10 years ago and turned around and sold it on amazon. Like the other review said, abe's the only ON in Hawaii and I never thought Chino could sound so bad. I want to see dEFTONES performing their high energy concerts, not watching boring acoustic stuff played sloppy. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they released this! Check out Area 4 Live or Deftones Pinkpop 2003 on youtube to see a genuine dEFTONES show. I expect much better from them. I have dEFTONES concerts on dvd(thankfully) so i can live without this!",0
3749,"An excellent debut album!!!: The biggest two reasons to buy this album are for the songs Naveed and Starseed. These two songs easily stand out on the whole album. Although all the others are great tunes too, Naveed and Starseed have tunes that will get stuck in your head and will make you want to hear them over and over. This CD is great.",1
3750,so far their best: yes this album is more harder than the others but it is still good. and i like every song on here because they're all good.1.armatage shanks-good way to start the album off 8/102.brat-a song about a stupid kid who wants his parents to die so he can get their inheritence.It's still good.9/103.stuck with me-I don't see why most people don't like this song10/104.geek stink breath-another good song 10/105.no pride-it's NOT a filler 9/106.bab's uvula who?-one of my favorites 10/107.86-my favorite on the whole album 10/108.panic song-I love the instrumental beginning 9/109.Stuart and the ave.-another good song with great basswork at the beginnig 9/1010.brain stew-it's good 8.7/1011.jaded-my least favorite on the album and I still like it 8/1012.westbound sign-a decent song 8.5/1013.tight wad hill-what insomniac was originally going to be called 9/1014.walking contradiction-a great way to end a great album 9/10,1
3751,Many plastic parts - stops delivering pressure to tire: I've had this pump a few years and use it infrequently. Stored gently. Never knocked down. Looks brand new. But now it leaks somewhere - impossible to tell without immersing it - around the joint where tube rotates. I conclude poor design and cheap materials.,0

However i have used many electric razors over the years and this is the first to ever give me razor burn that is actually as bad if not worse then i get from using a regular razor.. it may be because i have to go over each area time and time again to get it to do its job.. not real sure.. i just know that it gives me bad razor burn. and i have given up and ordered a norelco.,0
3757,Steve Guttenberg's Last Police Academy Movie!.: I watched the movie Police Academy 4 and I liked it and thought it was funny and I recommend it. This is Steve Guttenberg's last Police Academy movie and the later movies just weren't the same without him.,1

3759,"Good!: I've always liked books of short stories, because you don't need to stay invested for 300+ pages if you have other things going on. You can pick it up and set it down without feeling like you'll miss something, or forget an important element when you have to stay away for weeks while class is in session or other priorities have you running.This is a noteworthy collection of shorts by one of the masters of storytelling. Stand-outs in my opinion include The Mist, The Jaunt, and The Raft, but there's interest to be found throughout. Some of the very short ones such as Cain Rose Up, which almost seems like an exercise in some parts, read well nonetheless and draw you in to the tale, considering they're only a few pages in length.Bottom line for me: not all of the stories will bowl the reader over, but there's certainly a lot of good to be found in these pages.",1
3760,"Rugurgitation: I am so sad. As soon as I began leafing through this little book I recognized every single thing I read on every page... because I already read it.Someone took the original ""He's Just Not That Into You"" & re-typed it with only 1-2 sentences per page.Talk about stretching content to make a sale.",0
3761,"I totally disagree with Kathy!!: The French version was ok but the American was a lot better. The cast in the french version was slow and well boring. The movie itself was bad the lighting, voices, actors and actresses I didnt like it at all. In the American version it is fast good lighting good actors and actresses and downright funny, and for us americans a lot easier to watch! So I give it 5 stars all the way!!",1
3762,"Great, easy, versatile.: I've used dozens of ball heads. I needed a quick, cheap replacement for my tripod head that just broke. This one came well rated, but I was willing to take the chance. Glad I did. I works well - should get 4 stars, but my only complaints are that the 1/4"" mount on the bottom is really a 3/8"" mount with a little converter - If I lose that little bit, I have a useless head AND the grip doesn't grip so well once you have a heavier camera (imagine a mid-range zoom, flash or pocket wiz, batteries, cable, etc.), but it remains mostly sturdy. I find I'm able to sight in my shot with the hand-trigger held, then I slowly release to lock it in - no problems there. The screw mount on the tripod needs to be occasionally re-tightened which is annoying while you're working, but alleviated by adding some cheap foam to give the head something to stick to.",1

3764,"This makes so much sense: As a kindergarten teacher and mother of two teen-aged sons, I have to say that this book changed both the way I teach and the way I approach the loaded topic of reading with my sons. I had been a book snob for years, not allowing certain kinds of books based on comics or movies into my home or classroom. After reading this book, I called a meeting for the parents of my students and told them I was going to scour the thrift stores that weekend for ""trashy"" books with high kid appeal. I bought books with Star Wars characters and Scooby Do on the covers, and my kids were clamoring to borrow them.With my teen-agers, I told them I was taking them to the book store and that they had to pick something out. My 17 year old rolled his eyes but picked out Maus, which he loved. My 14 year old got The Weekly World News, (a tabloid) and now wants a subscription. Please get this book back in print.",1

3770,"No suspension of disbelief possible: Earth to five star people: Five stars is a rating reserved for masterpieces, which this book most assuredly is not.

3772,"Porta-Nails 421P Pneumatic Floor Nailer: I think this nailer has the potential for being very good, albeit in its current model it falls very short of what I expected. All too frequently it jams or the nails are not recessed correctly if at all. I find that using a manual nailer is much simpler, safer and if you factor in the time needed to fix all the jams - is much quicker (and a heck of a lot cheaper). I would give this current model two thumbs down and would not recommend it to anyone who lays hardwood flooring for a living.",0

Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...",0

Actually, I was a bit envious as this is the definitive book I would write on Tiki culture if I could. The history, factors, collectibles and magic of Tiki are covered in tremendous detail. Amazing illustrations, photos, trivia, historical notes and more await all fans of Tiki culture. I would say that Kirsten's book delves further into Tiki culture than any book this Tiki collector has ever seen. Simply a must buy for anyone who loves Tiki culture, or anyone looking to discover the magic of this ""lost"" time. I'm buying 2 copies--one for my friend and one for me.",1

I'm not at all saying he thinks the Holocaust is funny but I don't joke about it like I don't joke about slavery, wars or other examples of man's ability to become sadisic monsters. Who knows, maybe Anne Frank finds it funny from somewhere beyond the grave but I can't. I, too, have been to Anne's secret annex in Amsterdam. It was a place to mourn and a reminder to not be hateful in our own lives. I loved ""me talk pretty"" and even liked the quirky, selfish character he portrays himself to be but the stories in this book are bland and that single story made me feel immensely sad.",0

Sadly only a real true GRISHAM fan can half appreciate this book.,1

The positions that the instructor wants you to hold require a lot, repeat a lot of flexibility. I think it's a great video, but it should come with a disclaimer. Beginners: if you can't do it, don't force it and hurt yourslef. I really sweat a lot during the video so it was well worth it, however I think some beginners would want a little more explanation before they jump into the excercises. I highly recommend this video if you need to refresh your jazz, or you're a beginner who promises to take it a little easy. :)",1

3804,"Horrible Book: This book is absolutely terrible. It's nearly comparable in awfulness to Chuck Palanuik's Damned. The humor is obvious and contrived. I appreciate dry humor, but this isn't even entertaining. The sad part is I usually enjoy a Christopher Moore book, but I hated the fact that I owned this book so much that I immediately deleted it from my reading history on iBooks so I wouldn't have to remind myself that I spent hours of my life reading it. I felt pity for Christopher Moore knowing that he actually spent a great deal of time and effort researching the history behind this book. Let me add that in no way, shape, or form am I religious or upset about the fact that he is writing a fiction story regarding the Bible, this review is solely based on how unentertaining and idiotic this book is.",0

3809,"Interesting Design But Needs Work: The coffee maker looks nice and incorporates some good features, but has two drawbacks, in my opinion. First, since the opening for the water reservoir is right behind the top of the filter basket you need to be careful not to let the water splash into the coffee filter.Second, the machine is aluminum on the outside with a black plastic liner, and there is no water level indicator on the outside. You are supposed to lean over the machine (hard to do if it is under a cabinet) and look down at the water reservoir and gauge the water level against a grey plastic graduated stick against the black plastic sides. I realize you could just measure the water you pour in to begin with, but that is an extra step if, like me, you use a water filter such as Pur or Brita.In summary, it's a nice machine, but the water reservoir should be separated from the coffee filter, and there should be an external water level indicator.",0

3811,A Total Disappointment: I did not see the original PBS broadcast but have read the reviews of those who did. It is terrible that a dvd of a broadcast would have less features than the broadcast when it is usually the other way around.This dvd was not done very well. The vintage footage is minuscule. How could they pare down a 90 minute show to just 40 minutes?I could barely hear some of the singers. They were drowned out by the band. The sound system was not very good. I fast forwarded through most of this dvd.,0

3813,"As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible: ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's ""Pogo"" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.",0

Panzram details his life from childhood through the hardships of adulthood which made him the hardcore savage animal that he ultimately became. I loved every minute of this book! It's a shame that it's so hard to find though or I'd buy my own copy and read it every night before I go to bed.

As Ms. Owens points out in her magnum opus, nothing could be further from the truth. The Berkshires are not merely the petri dish of the grotesque - they are also the locus of many random cottages, scattered hither & thither across the landscape, which it behooves any self-respecting human to visit, nay to study in depth. Yes, you will visit the Berkshires for the inbreeding & the unsolved homicides, but you will stay for the COTTAGES. Huzzah!",1

NOW the producers have changed the name back to INVASION again to cash in on the TV series, INVASION, about to broadcast. This movie is not WELLS. It is not WAR OF THE WORLDS. The nudity that they put in it is bland and you are better off renting PORN if you want that. Avoid this movie like the plague. If you look at this company's website, they gleefully have knocked off (copied) many bigger movies as their mainstay. If this movie were a newspaper it would make the fish wrapped in it smell bad.",0
3820,"Clumsy plot, near-offensive gay caricatures: Setting aside a gaping hole or two in the plot, the scenes of gay nightlife and the way the mystery progresses triggered all my ""latent homophobia"" radar. I understand McDermid has written excellent books featuring a lesbian detective, but based on this book, I figured her to be an over-simplifying dolt, not quite a ""gay basher"" but having more of a ""Look at these ever so *intersting* people in the zoo!"" kind of vibe, which in some ways is worse. I also read ""Place of Execution"" which i liked much better, but in both cases you wish the author were sitting beside you so you could ask a few basic questions and point out glaring inconsistances or ask about ridiculous assumptions on which the plot rests.",0

But the movie paints itself into a corner - it winds up hinging on whether or not the high school football coach will forgive his star player for vandalizing his home. Hardly riveting drama. The blue-collar town mood of ALL THE RIGHT MOVES seems realistic. Actress Lea Thompson plays the most All-American young woman I have ever seen on the silver screen. And the film does not exaggerate the kooky love-hate relationship sports fans have with their teams, if you recall what happened to pro athletes Bill Buckner and Mitch Williams after they blew big games.

3827,"Paranormal At Its Best!: Hawk Adams could brave anything but love for a woman. After rescuing Charity Starr from her enemies, he unknowingly puts her in mortal danger himself when in her hospital room he opens her paranormal abilities and expands them to dangerous levels. Throughout the book, Hawk's lack of trust for Charity endangers and pains her greatly, not just physically but emotionally as well. Sexual tension grows between them as they face each other and the people who want to kill Charity. Slowly but surely a bond forms and love blooms in their hearts for one another. Hawk needs Charity to heal his wounded heart, and Charity needs Hawk to love her and complete her fully.Ms. Clark's characters are outstanding and unforgettable in this dramatic tale of love and peril. They are so real that they live and breathe within you. Hawk and Charity are so true to life you can almost forget it is only a book. Such a splendid job Ms. Clark!...",1

Aside from the incongruent terminology, blurry pictures (probably swiped from the web) and convoluted instructions, it instructs you to use the pincing kind of clippers rather than the shearing kind. The pincing clippers give you link joints that dont meet, creating mail that sometimes won't even stand up to costume wear. She also uses unusually thick wire for my tastes.

There's currently a spanish radio station on that frequency, and its pretty strong, making the music static-y. Hopefully everyone else not around the LA area has better luck.

Anyone wishing to pursue further personal study has broad cross section of topics, biographies and events to choose from.

However the books that focus on multi-day trips can be overwhelming and difficult to use for day hikes. I own one of them also and so speak from experience.For day hikes the great strengths of this book are: 1. Its selectivity. The walks are great choices. Magnificent ways to experience the country. 2.

""The Grapes of Wrath"" is outstanding, but ""East of Eden"" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: ""Timshel"" (""thou mayest""). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around ""Timshel.""This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love ""East of Eden.""",1
3868,"The Eternal Tony Bennett: I think Tony Bennett is a national treasure and that anyone with a love for Standards should buy this recording (and a few copies for friends).

I wish I could afford to see him at Pittsburgh's Heinz Hall this November.",1

3870,Not as good as it sounds.: While I very much understand what Penny Patterson has accomplished in her research over the years with Koko this movie was just a little to dated for me. I would have liked to see this in an updated form including new footage with her and Koko now as opposed to them together in the late 70's living in a trailer with Penny yelling no at Koko every 10 seconds.The thing that really affected me with this movie was what passed for a Zoo back in 1978.,0
3871,"Where's the Heart: This album was a colossal let down for me. First let me say I am a big Sahara Hotnights Fan I love every single song on all 3 of their previous releases. This album however is so bland and unoriginal, They used to have a good mix of rock and pop and a sound all their own. But on this album it sounds like an overly poppy set of B-sides some of them are catchy but none of them are very distinguishable from songs that came out 10 years ago. I am still a big fan of their old stuff and I will still buy their next album, every band tries a new sound out eventually but this new sound is lacking heart and, for lack of a better word balls.",0

Men have a lot more power in attracting women... (hot chick with ugly guy, but never the opposite). Women have looks, hence the need to use this book.",0

And so James T.Kirk and crew are sent to deal with the threat.Unfortunately, for most of this film very little happens. It seems to be aimed more at '2001' fans than 'Star Trek' fans. The characters are rarely allowed to show character and some of the dialogue is pretty stupid ('it disappeared down what they used to call a black hole'). Who exactly talks like that?Good special effects and a wonderfully atmospheric score save this film from being a one-star. Thank goodness the makers of Star Trek 2 onwards knew what the series was supposed to be about.",0

When I was a kid, we would call this type of music ""hillbilly music"", but now I suppose you'd say ""bluegrass"" or ""old timey"". Every song on this album is great. This week my favorite is ""Tramp on the Street""-- last week it was ""Give Me the Roses While I Live"". Probably if I had to pick an all-time No. 1, it would be ""I Didn't hear Nobody Pray"".

There's no way you can pronounce these words by just studying letters in those couple pages. How do you suppose to learn the languagage by trying to read letters you've never seen and practiced in your life before? I don't know what the writer was thinking about this when he wrote the book. And if you want to buy the tapes, there's a ""not very informative"" tape purchase option in the last page.I assume this book is written to teach how to read and write Armenian for those who already know how to speak Armenian.

3886,"Boring, boring, boring!: I remembered this movie fondly from my youth and wanted to introduce my children to it. I can't believe how boring it is. It is pretty much a travel guide, loaded with beautiful scenery but with little or no action. If it weren't for the antics of Cantinflas, this movie would be totally worthless. David Niven's Phileas Fogg is a bore who does nothing but play cards and look at his watch. Shirley MacLaine as an Indian princess? Even the character of Detective Fixx is a bore.

I have other air condiditioners in the house more than 20 years old that are much quieter. Why they can't make a quiet air conditioner today is beyond me. Another irritating feature is the piercing beep emitted every time you use the remote control. I don't need an annoying confirmation that I just did what I did.

I have searched bookstores high and low--worldwide--and have not been able to find it. Let's hope the publisher reprints this masterpiece, for it is one of the most important novels of the 20th century. It reflects the spiritual, political, and social confusion in our post-colonial world. My one regret is that so many students of world literature are lead to believe that it is comparable to Achebe's When Things Fall Apart. I tend to disagree. Achebe's work isn't as memorable. Reader's of this book should also read V.S. Niapul's A Bend in the River, which is a modern Heart of Darkness. All three of the above mentioned books are haunting. I think we, Americans in particular, need to realize that there is more to world ""affairs"" than Bill and Monica. This book will show readers how trivial our daily concerns really are.",1

The overall tone is harsh throughout making soft passages thin and louder passages clipped. Bass extension is essentially absent, robbing the performance of an important sense of depth. Lastly, in a time when DTS and Dolby surround mix can realistically expand the sound stage and envelop the listener, this mix seems to merely reproduce the front channels and add nothing to the experience. Certainly there are other top-level performances that are technically enjoyable as well?",0

I have had it for less than 9 months and almost all the writing on the keys is gone.

The story is a simple one, yet it really pulled me in until I had to keep reading. It usually takes me a month or two or three to get through a book, but this one took only about four days.

It then goes on to explain in detail how to burn data to a CD-ROM, followed by another few pages of how to create a contact sheet for the CD's jewel case. Just before the serious reader gives up on the book, it finally gets us to Adobe Bridge and the beginnings of information with substance. Though the book is filled with useful practical information, it is so bloated with banter-like filler that it makes for tedious reading. Like so many other of these types of how-to computer books, the some 450 pages could easily be condensed to half the size.

MUCH MUCH better for kids and anyone else who has trouble gracefully lifting 3 quarts of liquid with one hand (read: most everyone). With this design you simply open the door and fill using the tap. With the pitcher models, the tilt and weight tend to be awkward and I think spill or overpour about 30% of the time -- especially in the middle of the night.

3934,"Foreign Country: It's interesting that this album, and Neko's music on the whole, is categorized as Country. It doesn't feel like one to me. Undoubtedly, ""the Virginian"" was a Country album, and all of her albums have included some Country songs. What I've always loved about Neko's music is that it's always uses that genre as an anchor, but then circles it in an ever-widening search for something new. She's been on a journey, it seems, and this album is the first that feels like a new destination. Her music has always been unique in how it builds traditional Country music structures around what are often dark, poetically opaque lyrics. It's an unusual contrast. But on this album, she even moves away from traditional song structures. It feels like she's finally in a place that's hers. And her voice has never been better. I honestly think you could hate Folk music, Country music, and still get addicted to this album purely because of her voice.",1

Unfortunately, the follow-up was even more fragmented. It sounds like 3 mini-albums: Richie Furay's Poco outakes, Chris Hillman's Manassass outakes and J.D Souther's Eagles/Jackson Browne tribute act. Allegedly, Furay was heard to remark forlornly during recording sessions 'and to think I left Poco for this?'. I rest my case.",0

They're thick and opaque enough to completely cover old labels. And, of course, they're self-sticking, so no more worries that the label will be torn off during shipping. As others have written, it pays to do a little experimenting with your particular printer before committing a real label, but once you know the quirks of your system, making your shipping labels is a breeze. I wish I'd known about these a long time ago! Though these are designed for ink jet printers, they work just fine in a laser printer, too.",1

The box the chisels come in is pretty flimsy and cheaply made...don't let the fact that these chisels have a box to store them in influence your decision to buy. I had heard good things about these chisels from friends and neighbors who had them but had never seen them until I received my Amazon order.The chisel handles are hard plastic but upon further inspection of my chisels, one of them had a crack in the plastic with some of the plastic already missing! The chisels were brand new as they had no wear marks at all! The plastic had cracked all the way down to the metal and that was enough of an omen for me to return them! The chisels just look cheaply made to me.Returned to Amazon and went to Sears and bought some Craftsman chisels...I am VERY happy with them.",0

Before I purchased this book I would say, ""What is watercolor?"" but now I have a whole new perspective on different art and media. Bacically, I became an artist overnight because of THIS book!

I understand it is difficult to get away from some of the jargon, but I know it is possible to explain math in a more practical way. Unfortunately, this book is much more like the class room explanation. It has obviously been written by a mathematician.

Littlefoot and Cera are shown to be spiteful, Cera's dad is a raging, lying bully and Grampa has regressed from being a wise elder to being a weak and ignored character. The plot: Littlefoot feels inadequate for being short so he tries to eat the tree blossoms that Cera's dad guards fiercely. The tiny dinos come and eat what Littlefoot knocks down, Littlefoot lies to protect himself and Cera's dad organizes a posse to hunt and kill the little ones. The songs include references to eliminating others, how bad dads are, and other choice themes I'd rather not sing aloud with my 5 year old son. This is by far the worst of the lot.",0

I could not find any information in the various submarine books that have been written, until I discovered Admiral Davenport's book in my local library. Aside from the book being extremely boring, I found it interesting that the Admiral disliked Clay Blair's description of him in his book 'Silent Victory'. I got the impression that the only reason Davenport wrote his book was to defend himself over Blair's portrayal. What do you expect from a former Journalist? The book for the most part reads like a series of patrol reports, nothing original. The O'Kane or Fluckey books are a much better read. Fortunately, the book is available in most libraries. I don't see the publisher printing a second edition anytime soon.",0

Often both will end up going through and this is the best I can hope for. The engineering on this machine is seriously deficient. You do not want the repetitive agony this has to offer.",0

3977,DULL DAVIS? I'M AFRAID SO.....: Dreary Davis vehicle which should never have been made. She's a famous authoress living in England who murders an inconvenient ex-husband. She's having it off with her secretary's boyfriend (who's much younger) and thinks she's pulled off the perfect crime (she's a mystery writer) until a former partner of the husband's shows up. He offers to cover for her but things get ridiculously out of hand and he kills her prize horse. This is not good. Then begins a game of wills that ends most ironically as Davis falls prey to her own schemes. She hams it up in this one and leaves no co-star unscathed. Murky b&w photography doesn't help either. It's slow and very stagy throughout. Her then husband Gary Merrill plays the partner and even he seems at a loss over how to cope with the script. If a Davis film can be called a total waste then this is it. Even she can't save it from sinking into tedious boredom. Stick with her other films instead and forget this turkey.,0

3979,"Dangerous wolf in sheep's clothing: Now here is a strange book written by an educated Christian who teaches at a seminary in St. Louis. Collins has come up with the analogical days theory to explain the six days of creation (he thinks the six days were several years). He builds his entire case on a very poor interpretation of Genesis 2:5. We'll probably be hearing more about this in the next few years, and for that reason it is good to know what his case is (and it is very weak). Collins suggests a literal interpretation of the Bible is bad, but then he continually leans on this method to build his cases for a variety of bad expositions including long ages (millions of years) having passed since the universe was created and support for macro-evolution. His book is written in a very friendly manner that kind of warms you up to him, but his shared opinions and interpretation of some Scripture is very, very bad. The sad thing is knowing that this stuff is actually being taught in a seminary.",0

She and I have both laughed for years at Jancis' smarmy tone in her column in Wine Spectator, though I also found her very knowledgeable about wine.

This CD was the first time I bought a score type soundtrack instead of ones filled with songs played in a movie (and overplayed on radio). The tracks are all enjoyable. The ones that really stand out are Battle Of The Universe (a laid back futuristic battle march), Love Muscle (a techno-ish dance nightmare, but I love it), and Zev's Shower (a beautiful, feminine journey).

The idea of Poe as a character was intriguing enough for me to read the book, and through much of it, the quality of the plot and dialog was top notch. Unfortunately, about 2/3 in, you could see which way the plot was going, and it was a disappointment to find a plot unfolding that was reminiscent of Cornwall or Patterson at their commercial worst.

4016,"Enthusiastic sadomasochism: Skillful narrative, amazing events; hideousness and beauty; attention to sexual (and historical) details, gruesome and original plot. But there's a chilly lack of heart in this novel which all the brains and visual effects in the world can't fix. One of the characters, Blanche, says of her brother, ""His eyes revealed more than the usual contempt common to his kind of Englishman (...) pure hatred."" Flanagan's meticulous emotionless descriptions almost seem like a form of cruelty.On second thought, is that the point? Puzzling.",1

I was a bit taken aback when it was delivered to my house, and was actual people size!I suppose it's still pretty cool, what with the stereo and all.But action figure enthusiasts are likely to be disappointed by the sheer size.

4018,"instant joy out of the box: This is one of those goofy little gadgets that you see but are pretty sure somehow or another it won't quite work out. Kind of like that shakeweight you bought from that late night infomercial. That said, my thumbs were taking too much of a beating from reloading - it was making me not want to shoot quite so much, so I tried it out. It is a wonderful little device! For a 92FS factory mag it fit like a glove. I actually use it ""backwards"", which is to say instead of having the bullet-end of the magazine facing left in my left hand and using my thumb to press the lever, I put the bullet-end of the mag right and use my left index finger to press the lever. Makes it sooooo much easier to load the mag, and now I'm focusing on shooting and not on loading. Must have for your range bag.",1

It took me years to get around to it after hearing all the fuss and I still do not know the source of the commotion.

A few weeks ago we saw Bobby McFerrin at the Kennedy Center in Washington and my daughter fell in love with him. She doesn't remember hearing the recording as a baby so I ordered it on cd for her. We now argue over who's turn it is to use it because I have introduced it to the class of 4 year olds I teach and it's their favorite thing to listen to!

4036,"Not so flawless video....: Laura Mercier may indeed be a very talented makeup artist when it comes to celebrities, who as we know are blessed with good looks by God. However while viewing this brief and rather primitive video I failed to notice dramatic changes after her makeover of 6 ""ordinary"" women. I didn't discover any new makeup tips for myself either. In my opinion this video is for people who have no idea about makeup whatsoever, as it provides very limited and basic information on techniques and products. (Without saying, Laura Mercier advertises her own skincare and makeup lines only). I also find Laura's roundtable discussion about the purpose of makeup to be a waste of time in this 27 minute video. My expectations for this video were much higher.",0
4037,"No frills, just easy to make recipes: This video starts with an interview with Roy Pingo who has worked with famous chefs like Michael Field and Julia Childs. He has also attended some of the finest schools in the world. Roy is not a polished television personality by any means; if anything, he comes across as a nice guy making with a passion for cooking and someone you'd want to have cooking at your house. His recipes are a GREAT start and a good base for the culinary novice (I have modified his Madeira Mushroom sauce to one that I am constatly begged for!). What's great about this video is Roy has opted not to cook his recipes on the stove you'll see in the background. Instead, he cooks on a single, electric burner, proving the point that good food is the result of a combination of good fresh ingredients, not special pots and pans sitting on a five million dollar stainless steel stove. I would buy this video and keep it on hand if you're not one to regularly fix sauces.",1

It lays plain the immorality of not only socialism, but capitalism as practiced today.The modern era of industrialism with its supposed abolition of slavery actually has resulted in the vast majority of men & women worse off than that of slaves - slaves without the benevolence of masters.Written in anti-bellum days, the ideas of this book have been buried underneath the rubble of the conquest of the confederacy. While Fitzhugh's ideas are in need of further exploration, such has never been done since his ideas are discarded by the feminized society in which we live. Hopefully they may rise again to be considered.",1

4042,"IT SUCKED!!!!: I am now more than ever fully convinced that many of the people who post reviews on this site are shills working for the movie studios. How else to explain glowing reviews for unmitigated dreck like Envy, National Lampoon's Dorm Daze, and other garbage? True to form, several people have already posted a positive review of Elektra. I love comic books. I have loved comic books for almost thirty years. It pains me to see bad comic book movies because I know these movies contribute to negative public perception of comic books. Elektra was a bad comic book movie. I feel bad for Jennifer Garner. She demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for the character and was not shy about telling interviewers about how she enjoyed reading the Elektra comics. But this movie is plain awful. The story plods along with very little action. It is just plain boring. I saw this movie with three fellow comic book fans and we were all bitterly disappointed.",0
4043,"Not really worth the Money: I have always been a fan of novelization of show or movies because I think that the novel enriches the story, but the case of the novelization of Endgame just is not worth the money. The book did nothing to add on to the of Star Trek Voyager last show. The writing of Diane Carey is usually very good, but in this case it like she just copy from the script. The ONLY reason someone may want to buy it is get a preview of the up coming book ""Homecoming"" by Christie Golden. Beside this I can't see any reason in purchasing the book.",0

Young Renny takes place in 1906 and is a real coming-of-age book. Quite humorous in places. Written in 1935, there's a subltety about one of the characters(Malahide)that I was surprised to find. Adeline remains a force to be reckoned with. Don't miss this book if you're reading the Jalna series!",1

A couple months ago, it started cracking while my husband was rocking our daughter to sleep. I made him get up, and sure enough, the back had broken from the base. We had just moved and I figured that maybe the screws had been loosening from all that handling or something. I removed the screws and the little metal grip thing that provides the threads in the base. I drilled new holes, and put it back together. A few days ago, it broke again while he was rocking her. This time, I went and bought new bolts with nuts and repaired it again. It seems really strong, and I don't see how it could break there now... hopefully it won't break somewhere else. I could not afford to buy a new chair, otherwise I definitely would have!",0

I have given 5 star ratings to other Pure Bar flavors, but this one totally disappointed me. I wish I could return the box.",0
4053,"Horrible doesn't begin to describe it: After reading some of the reviews for Eldest I'm beginning to wonder if this was supposed to be published on April 1 as an april fool's joke. This book reads like an april fool's joke what with the characters being pulled around like puppets and talking like they dropped in from cartoonland.I find it hard to believe any honest to goodness person read and liked Eldest. After rolling my eyes the umpteenth time at this stupipdity of the characters, I gave up. I couldn't even get my kids to read it. In a way, I'm glad my kids didn't read it. No good parent would let their kids read a book where characters are so lacking in values.",0

4061,"John Carpenter's worst film.: I'll give Carpenter his due. Carpenter over his career has been a better director than the overrated Wes Craven whose only had in my opinion 1 good movie which was A Nightmare On Elm Street. Carpenter has made some classics such as Assault on Precinct 13 and Halloween and he has also made some good movies like The Fog and The Thing and to a point They Live which was his last good film. But Carpenter also releases crap such as Prince Of Darkness, Ghosts Of Mars and the remake of Village Of The Damned. When Carpenter is off the mark, he is really off the mark and then his work is nearly unwatchable and Price Of Darkness is no exception. This is a real snoozer from beginning to end. Definitely not recommended even for Carpenter buffs.",0
4062,"Hmmmm....: Buy this game if you have alot of patience, because load times are long and this game has a habit of freezing up.

But as far as gameplay goes, well brand new it is [not much money]. That says it all. Any good game will not sell for [that amount] when it is newly released. Would I purchase for [that amount] knowing how the game is? Probally not, I would recommend renting this game, if you can find it for rent. Replay value on this game is pretty low.",0

4064,"Such great lessons!: I highly recommend this book. I love the Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka books. They are about 3 girls who are raised in rural Sweden. This book is about how the 3 girls will need bikes for the upcoming school year. Instead of asking their parents to buy them bikes, they plant a garden and sell their produce at the market. It is lovely. My only complaint is that the font is a bit small and different from the original books. Also, the pictures are not exactly what I remember the girls looking like. We have several of these books. They offer such great opportunities to discuss doing what is right, working hard, and being kind.",1

There's no software included!: The product description under features ""*Create your own calendar"" and one product review that refers to software included in a similar product led me to the assumption that this kit included software to make a calendar.

Unfortunately, after we played the game for about 15 minutes, they got bored and wanted to stop. I have to admit, it was not too thrilling or interesting to play. The game set up is a little odd, and rather dull. Save your money for the ""Jump In"" CD - the next hot Disney TV musical out.",0

Now, this MINA: THE DRACULA STORY CONTINUES comes along to further desecrate Stoker's masterpiece. Where are the bats, the mists, the wolves, the deeds of horror and bloodlust? If you want some mushy romance novel, then this is fine. If you want a true sequel to DRACULA that's a gothic horror story in the tradition of Stoker, then THIS AIN'T IT!!

Unfortunately, this game is a big disappointment. I wanted to like it, I really did! But compared to similar games, this one is just lacking. It reminds me a lot of Might and Magic, but the gameplay just doesn't work as well. And the multiplayer just doesn't work either; additional players can only attack when it's their turn during battle. In short, they occasionally get to push one or maybe two buttons every once in a while.I give the game two stars because it seems like good effort, but in the end it just doesn't work as an enjoyable game.",0

4083,"Terribly Disappointing: I really wanted to like this book because I've enjoyed other works by Tim O'Brien but I was terribly disappointed. I'm not a reader who looks for an easy ending, but I do want a satisfying one, whether that ending be happy or sad, whether it answers all questions or leaves some of them unanswered. In the Lake of the Woods, however, exhibits no emotional power. Essentially a character study, it fails to give us a character TO study. Both John and his wife, Kathy, are shallow people and not developed enough to care what happens to them or their marriage. I don't care if Kathy met a lover, was risky, or was killed. Nor do I care who killed her. Had O'Brien done his job, I would have cared deeply. I'm sure we're meant to identify with John Wade's anguish and pain, but I just couldn't. He wasn't real for me. I need A LITTLE MORE character development than ""Kath. Oh, Kath,"" to feel empathy for anyone.",0

4089,"Breaks down after about 2 years: Mosquito Magnet Liberty Mosquito Trap MM3000We live in northern Minnesota and we get a lot of mosquitoes. The first unit worked great and we noticed a relief from these pests within a few days. We were so pleased that we bought a second one after two years. The first one lasted about 3 years, the second one about one year. The company would like us to ship the heads and last year the charge for each replacement would already have been $ 100. After spending almost $ 1000 for both units we will not spend another $ 200 for something that breaks down after such a short time. We would not recommend the Mosquito Magnet to anyone and we would not buy another one.",0
4090,"One of the Worst Spy movies of all time!: Without a doubt, The Good Shepherd is one of the worst spy movies I have ever seen and I think I have seen almost all of them. I'm not sure where to begin with how bad it is. The main character Edward Wilson is absolutely lifeless and there is zero explanation as to why 3 women find him attractive. There is zero explanation as to how he advances as he seems to do nothing. There are so many contradictions, dead ends, events unexplained and mistakes that you would think an amateur wrote this film. The movie is deliberately dark so as to give the Cloak and Dagger mystique but it fails miserably. And the worst part is it tries to shed the fictional cloak by trying to tie itself to real world events but again fails with so many mistakes that it becomes simply boring and ludicrous. Based on the critics reviews I had high hopes for this movie but I usually find that when the critics hail a movie that it is a bad sign.",0

4092,"Hardly enjoyable: I rented Punch-Drunk Love with the expectation of seeing a beautiful, artistic, and meaningful film that I could treasure and watch over-and-over again.I found little to be treasured.Certainly, the cinematography was lovely, the eerie soundtrack suited the movie's mood perfectly, the actors (for the most part) performed their roles very well, but otherwise...Nothing about the movie held me. The complexities of the life of a man with various mental disorders do not interest me (when presented without any particular purpose or meaning). The love story between Sandler and his love-interest did not catch my interest either.I feel that this film has no binding point of interest. I'd pass on it if I were you.",0
4093,"Not New: I brought this item thinking I was getting a brand new bluetooth. I was wrong. It arrived in a bag and it was used. It has be worn and had scratches all over. When I turned it over it had ""REFURB"" printed on the back. I think the company should have adertised that it was a refurb product and not a new on. I also order the same one in black for my fiance and his was refurbed as well. However, it wasn't scratched up like this pink one. I order this product because I had a new one before and it was a wonderful product and lasted a long time. The only reason why I orderd a new on was because mine was destroyed in the washing machine and dryer. My mistake.",0
4094,"Great little scale-Excellent value: This scale looks stylish and provides an accurate weight. I don't know what else one might want from a scale, but that was sufficient for me. I checked the weight accuracy against the scales at my doctor's, a nutritionist's and my gym. All scales, including mine, were in agreement (to within less than one pound).Amazon was offering a $20 gift certificate for this purchase at the time (don't know if it's still available). That put the total cost to me with tax and shipping under $35. I couldn't beat or match that anywhere else.This scale does not provide a body fat measure. From what I read, that feature is often times inaccurate. But whether it is or not, I didn't want or need that feature, so no problem.If you can match this deal on Amazon or elsewhere for this scale, go for it.",1

Mr. Muhammad was a charismatic, cunning and shrewd man. There is no doubt he had to be to build an organization of this kind. But, he was a HUMAN BEING, and as such he had all the imperfections we all have.Many facts in the book are irrefutable, and easily verified by independent sources. Of the negative comments I read, no one can point to any substantial fact in the book and say it's wrong. In the end, read the book and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",1

Upon arrival I was a little disapponited in the length of the straps that ae used to fasten it to the visor. Apparently this design dates back a few years when vehicles had smaller visors. I was able to get it attached using the straps, but they are barely long enough, another inch would have been great. Other than that small issue it is designed very well and suit my needs for storage of gas tickets, business cards and the like.",1

While I love the actual device itself (I use it daily) it just seems a bit dishonest to me to raise the prices of the books so much so soon? I have had no problems with mine, but am feeling a bit decieved at the pricing. I understand that authors still need to make thier living, but come on.. it can't possibly cost as much to produce in a digital format than it does to produce whole books (not to mention saving trees)It really should be cheaper..",1

To start with, even though I like Emily Blunt, I found her natural British accent disconcerting within the confines of this particular movie. It just did not fit.

4115,"A Must For All Aerosmith Fans: I am a huge Aerosmith fan, and I also enjoy a little bit of Jazz, bluegrass, blues, etc, so I thought that this would be a good combo, and it is. This is a great album. It is not quite as rockin as Aerosmith, but smokes nonetheless. ""Dream On"" and ""Rag Doll"" are especially good. If you are expecting just a bland recounting of Aerosmith, think again. If you don't like to experiement, don't get this, but real Aerosmith fans understand their bluesy underpinnings and this fulfills those. Highly recommended.",1

I have achieved over 1.5 million points in a game that lasted several days and 64 levels (it saves your current game and you can replay another day) but eventually the board freezes up and the game is lost at least for me.It is a tense game but between every level, it pauses and you click continue when you are ready.

4137,"This is a wonderful album: Painful experience has taught me to approach albums by actor/musicians with caution. I was delighted to find that it was unecessary in this case. There's quite a variation of mood and tempo from one track to the next, from the upbeat ""My Sweet Selena"" (I suggest reading the back cover for more on the origin of the title. It's clever and very... well... sweet) to the whistful longing of ""So I Sit By the Sea."" ""Yes You In Blue"" goes on a bit of a tear with a slight flavor of the 60's and ""The Ballad Of William Robinson"" is wonderfully tragic. The songs themselves are well contructed and the tunes are the sort you'll find yourself humming without even thinking about it. I highly recommend this album!",1

As I read the carefully translated work, I could not even begin to imagine what any of his experiences must have truly felt like. Kang writes with such force that when writes of events that would change his entire outlook on life, you also feel as though you are being shocked into some uncertain reality. Kang's detailed account of his drive and determination to live and to escape the walls of the dangerous aquarium that is North Korea is both terrifying and beautifully written. Yair Reiner's translation is careful and well done, you won't feel as though you are missing anything from this translation. It is so difficult for me to identify anything that I did not like about this memoir. In my mind it is a must read and future classic.",1

I was surprised the book was published in 1991, it had the feel of a 1950's publication. The contents also seem to be out-of-date. Much of the text reflected the authors conjectures, beliefs and favorite idioms. There was no significant research of the subjects. Much of the ""advice"" or ""how to"" were not explained, if any was even given. I was clearly disappointed and would never have purchased the book if I had an opportunity to first examine the book.",0

4144,"A Mixed bag: This season was definitely a mixed bag, with several high points and low points. Don Draper, in particular, showed marked changes in character and demeanor. Apparently, he's showing his ""true inner self"" and is no longer the ""Be all/ Know all"" whom we've all come to expect. The other characters continue to grow and develope as well, and there is enough residual suspense to heighten our anticipation of next season's offerings. Overall, this season wasn't quite as good as Season 3 --down from 5-Stars to 4-Stars. But it was still a heckuva lot better than a lot of the other stuff found on TV.",1

Along with the material presented in class, this book provided great insight into basics of the Asian culture.This rather heavy book is perfectly organized chronologically and geographically. It provides great graphical supplement to the study of early Asian art. Many artifacts are portrayed, most with detailed description of their history and origin.I enjoyed my class greatly and this book provided great help to understanding Asian art. If you are a person who prefers visual aids rather than tons of text and would like to learn the basics of Asian art, I highly recommend this book. The photographs are excellent, and more often then not, actually motivate you to reading the descriptions of the portrayed objects. This book will not make you an expert on Asian art, but you'll be able to schmooze your way through at pretentious cocktail parties without any effort.",1

I would sit and watch the colored wheel spin, looking at the new presents that appeared every day under the tree, and this was always playing in the background. On Christmas Eve this played all day as we listened to the Santa Claus report on the radio. I would fall asleep (I have no clue how) listening to this still playing.

The protagonist is a 'grammaton cleric', a super-martial artist SS-officer type who enforces this creed. Our protagonist misses his dose and then explores a new path in his life.I loved this movie for the very interesting martial arts and ""gun-kata"" action.Equilibrium is not as improbable as the matrix because it is more grounded in realism. It's premise of a Bradburian Farenheit-451 / Orwellian regime is a bit shallow compared to those works.It you like films about totalitarian regimes or futuristic martial arts violence, you will not be disappointed.

Not only did the characters not learn from each other or develop over time, but I stayed much the same too from taking the journey with them.",0
4160,"This program is really not worth the money.: This is a very clunky, very limited piece of software. It converts files to mp3's from pretty much any other format. But that's it. You can't edit your sound files. You can't turn mp3's into other file formats (except .wav - but you can get freeware programs that do that). The CD writing options are limited. The only good point is that the interface is spiffy-looking.But the thing that makes me mad enough to get online and write a review is this: it won't let me completely fill my CDs. I can only use, say, 70 minutes out of an 80-minute CD or it will give me an error message. Or it will only allow me to write maybe 18 files to the disk, even if I have space left. I am very disappointed in this program and am kicking myself for buying it.",0

4163,"Skype made easy: We have had our system now for a couple of months. Bought this unit plus an extra handset. Signed up for the regular Skype plan at $36 per year which is all of North America at no extra fee. We make a lot of calls to the UK and they are only 2 cents/minute. You don't need a pc to use this system, you simply plug the wireless base unit into your broadband and your off and running. Had a slight problem getting the second handset to sync with the base, but I called customer service and they gave me a tip that was not in the written instructions that got things working. Quality is superb. Have had no dropped or choppy calls at all. Although you don't need a pc, maintaining your account online through a computer is easier than trying to do it on the phone. Highly recommended. The system is also portable. If you travel, simply take it with you and anywhere you can access a broadband connection, you have your Skype phone.",1
4164,"Unfortunate waste of a significant talent.........: Arthur Phillips can write. There are times as one reads Prague that one is nearly overwhelmed by Phillip's linguistic skill and descriptive capabilities. Unfortunately, this is such an unbalanced effort that the net effect of this realization is overwhelming frustration.The frustration in this novel is that while Phillips has an uncanny ability, through elegant prose, to skillfully evoke the sense of time and place that Budapest was in the immediate post-wall-collapse period, he juxtaposes this elegance against torpid, caricaturist characters devoid of any depth, intelligence, likeability or interest whatsoever. The end result is a multidimensional novel as to time and place populated by one-dimensional characters devoid of any connection to that time and place.Phillips has rare talent. One can only hope he will eventually put it to much better use in subsequent efforts than he did with Prague.",0

4167,"A Must-See: Whether you're a liberal or a conservative (or anywhere else on the political spectrum), this documentary is a must-see. I took a conservative friend of mine to see this film in theaters over the summer. Like so many others, he was an avid supporter of Bush because he had never been told why he shouldn't be. I asked him on the way into the theater who he was going to vote for. He replied ""Bush, of course!"" Knowing that we were walking into a movie which was sure to introduce many new issues to him, I said nothing. When it was over, as we were walking out, I asked him the same question once again. He replied, ""Definitely not that *ss-hole!"" Not knowing it was going to have such an impact on him, I said, ""Who do you mean?"" ""George Bush,"" he said, ""I am absolutely not going to vote for George Bush."" This film had a wonderful impact on my friend and I am certain that it will on just about anyone else who watches it. I give this documentary five stars and a big smile!",1

I did have an issue with it leaking around the base, but was able to resolve that problem. I took the dispenser apart and cleaned it well to make sure there was no soap residue. Then my husband put some pipe dope, similar to a liquid plumbers putty, around the neck of the dispenser where it attaches to the actual pump mechanism. Once that was dry, we reassembled it and it works great. That's the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. Other than that, the brushed nickel finish matches my faucet perfectly.

Since it is an convertible from leg press to hack squat the pad for the feet rocks back and forth which is very annoying along with the seat back moves around.

4184,"David Stanley's book fantastic!: David Stanley's guide to Tahiti is by far and away the most complete guide to the region that I have found. Having traveled in the area, it is refreshing to find a book that covers not only the high-profile aspects of the region, but also the out-of-the-way, behind the scenes views of the south seas. Mr. Stanley has a way of getting immersed in the culture and the communities but also sees things from a traveler's perspective. His intensive research, along with up to date information make it a pleasant and an enjoyable read. Not only are there plenty of resources listed, but the information given about the history and culture of the islands is fascinating to know before going. The numbers and prices listed are also current enough to be used at any point you decide to make the journey. This book is a fantastic guide to a magical place.",1

But I have a major problem with books or movies that depict the torture/murder of children. I can cope with it happening to adults, but not children or infants. If I had had any idea what happened in the hospital scene, I would never have checked this book out from the library. At least I didn't buy it. And I won't be buying it, hardcover or paperback. I really enjoyed the earlier books in this series. But a depiction of the slaughter of newborns is NOT entertaining to me.",0
4193,"An interesting examination from the Japanese point of view: I wrote a thesis in college about the Japanese seizure of Korea, and my main argument was that there was no nefarious plot to take over Korea; rather, the annexation was the result of conflicting elements within the Japanese government. (The annexation was, of course, a victory for the reactionary elements.)This book illustrates that there WERE elements within the Japanese government who wanted to help Korea reform. They certainly had ulterior (read: self-centered) motives in doing so, namely economic/financial gain. But there was, at least according to this book, a noted absence of imperialistic/expansionist attitudes by Meiji Japan towards Yi Choson Korea, at least for a time.It is a challenging examination of that time from the Japanese point of view, and it certainly merits a reading from the serious historian.",1

The side grabbers wouldn't reach past the ear to grasp the cabinet edge.The clamp would be OK for edge banding, but if you are doing anything else, be sure to check the required throat depth",0
4204,"Deficient: This is an interesting economic study, but is deficient in one major respect. The book assumes that separatism was entirely economic, rather than religious and political, and mistakenly supposes that the British actually supported Zionism, when quite the opposite is true.Beginning in 1929, for example, the British enforced Islamic law concerning Jewish prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, thereby prohibiting Jewish worshipers from approaching the sacred wall within 10 feet, and from sitting there. Furthermore, the British actually instigated Arab riots against Jews, and prohibited Jewish communities from defending themselves.Furthermore, while the book rightly acknowledges Arab attacks on Jewish communities in 1929, it fails to note that such attacks actually began more than 20 years earlier, and therefore preceded by a substantial margin any ""economic"" development cited herein.--Alyssa A.

4238,"Bad!: I saw Fagen in Chicago on 3/18/06. He started 20 minutes late, ended early, and only gave an encore of one song. He did mostly stuff from this album, and didn't seem to want to ""entertain"" that night. ""Bright Nightgown"" is the most tedious song he's ever done, with his backup singers repeating that title for a good 5 minutes or so. In light of his ""performance"" if you want to call it that, there's no way I'd buy this album.",0

4241,"Destined to Become The Mammals' Breakthrough Album: The title says it all - this is certainly a departure for The Mammals. Their two previous studio albums, Evolver and Rock That Babe were both very typical of the newgrass genre. Typical, but still incredible in their own right; boisterous, fun and traditional. While Departure has its moments of their previous rollicking nature, it is by far more focused on the rock side of their overall sound. The first clue to this is the lack of any traditional covers, rather, a cover of the Nirvana hit ""Come As You Are"" (done incredibly, by the way). The tone of this album is a bit more solemn than previous albums, but they have not lost their freewheeling spirit or folky edginess. They've just matured... a whole lot.",1

African black soap is high in glyernic than this soap. Through you may have to carefully keep African raw soap closed because of glernic and it doesn't have scent as pleasent like that soap.

The seat is wide enough for a comfortable adult fit and the interior diameter small enough to give a child the confidence they dont have to try and keep from falling in.

I'm a big fan of musicals and was excited to see a production of Jekyll and Hyde, Hasselhoff not withstanding. Unfortunatly he dosen't come close to meeting the vocal and acting challenges the dual roles require, and in the most intense scenes only succeeds in looking (and sounding) comical. Hasselhoff only looks more untalented next to the superb cast, namely Andrea Rivette and Collen Sexton. Buy it only if you're a big fan of musicals, or are willing to pay to see two brilliant performances diminished by a big name.",0

But to go so far as to spend over 2 hours exploring a guy who wasn't even a Beatle at all. I would have much rather had seen what made McCartney and Lennon so prolific together. How did all that music start? Who got what idea first? Where was the genius in all of this? In this film Paul comes off like a choir boy younger brother to the controlling Lennon. And where the heck is Ringo in all of this? A mere mention of him! This is supposed to be a film about the greatest rock band of the 20th century and we're wasting film on a guy who never even did anything of any value with the group!

So Thieu says he won't talk peace, Nixon wins, Kissinger openly changes sides after working with the Democrats, and together they crank up the war.The point is: The War could have ended in 1968 if it were not for this man - Dr Death himself, Henry Adolf Kissinger!",0

Yes, it is beautifully, achingly rendered. Every aspect is richly detailed and serves to draw you in and keep the pages turning. However, it feels like only half a story; like the author couldn't imagine a resolution that would satisfy, so he just gave up. The reader gets nothing. I understand that in real life people go missing and aren't ever found, but this was clearly a staged disappearance on Jennifer's part, and we never have an inkling of how or why. I know this is meant to be an examination of a downward spiralling psyche, and so it is. But without the rest of the story, it's just a lot of pretty phrases. Extremely disappointing.",0

I had contemplated buying the Anchor Bay DVD, and upon viewing, I'm so glad I didn't. Franco Nero is absolutely dreadful -- i'm not sure if he or the dubbing is to blame but the delivery and dialogue are some of the worst I've ever witnessed. The character is such a goody goody with lines like, ""You shouldn't treat women like that"" and ""That's not right."" To compare this to Leone is to reduce Leone's interesting characters and cinematography into cardboard gunfights. I didn't even finish the film.",0

He is sadly missed.This collection contains material from 1973-1990 and clearly demonstrates the consistency of Coyne's work through the years. His gravelly voice singing his sometimes tender, sometimes uhinged songs , some of which here are almost totally improvised, is the key sound of this disc. Even a variety of backing musicians seems to have no real effect on the overall sound, other than to enhance Coyne's wonderful tunes.If you are already familiar with Kevin Coyne's work then you know that this is well worth owning, for the beginner this may be a little too much to take.",1

The only problem is if you watch your old VHS and the new ""mastered"" DVD you'll see that they over simplified the colors on the new DVD. Where there once was shadow and texture and dark colors. It is now replaced with overly bright, no shadows, and flatness. Its kinda strange that something so old was better looking old. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see old clips that are on the DVD (see the Celine video on the DVD or the clips on some of the gmaes).

4297,"Quite boring but it keeps you off the streets for awhile.: I have to admit I didn't quite like this movie. The idea in itself is not a bad one, I haven't read the book so I can't say much about that but the movie is somewhat boring. It runs for about 3 hours when I get the idea that the plot would be better for a movie one hour shorter.I bought this movie knowing that it's director, Tobe Hooper, was the big man behind ""The texas chainsaw massacre"" which I loved. Salem's lot didn't live up to my expectations. It's plot develops real slow and it is quite predictable, the fact that it is an old movie doesn't justify that in any way. The movie desperately tries to create a chilling atmosphere yet never quite reaches it, which has nothing to do with the year the movie was made in.I can't say I found the watching of this movie a total waste of time, and it isn't expensive either. But if you like Tobe Hoopers work i'd skip this one and go straight to Poltergeist.",0

You can achieve this type of scare in your own home by putting on a blindfold and walking around a room full of set mouse traps scattered on your floor!

Instead of a period piece, or cultural revelation of that time period, we are served a poorly acted, ""in your face"", directionless movie in search of itself. While the son of sam seems artfully and accurately portrayed as the sub plot, it gets completely out of hand.

But the directing and cinematography looked like an afterthought to a home-made video of some vacation in Greece. I actually looked away from the screen several times because I was so embarrassed for the participants in this film. The acting was horrendous; similar quality might not bother you if you paid $2 admission to a small town high school stage production, but this is supposed to be a professional film. Even Streep's performance was embarrassing, though she at least surprised me as a much more competent singer than her peers. Some of the actors' singing was jaw-droppingly bad.

I tried to listen to it again, but...couldn't. It was just so bad. The bass figures are the sort of simplistic crap you expect from a high school garage band, the guitar doesn't do anything interesting on all but maybe one or two songs, and the vocals are buried so deep in the mix that you can't even hear them (though after looking at the lyrics in the liner notes, I decided this wasn't necessarily a bad thing).

Gone are the annoying samples and pseudo funk riffs from earlier mediocre releases like Megatop Phoenix and No 10 Upping St. This has the Clash sound back in almost full swing. The CD starts with a bang, with I Turned Out a Punk blasting away all the other songs. Psycho Wing is a truly personal, wrenching song with a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest theme. Some later tracks get weak, but all in all this is one of B.A.D.'s better releases.",1

The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only 19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!",1

Despite this book being 400 pages, I urge anyone who reads it to question how many people are really represented in it. Many readers will get the impression that massive of people followed these radical sects, but Hill occasional gives clues that actualy followers were much smaller in number. Also, despite the emphasis on smaller groups often unheard, there is an almost total absence of female voices even though women played a large part in the movement.While the book is not a light read, it is a must for anyone wanting to increase their knowledge of what English people were thinking on the eve of Revolution.",1

Friedman thinks he knows it all when it comes to ""analysing"" the Lebanese crisis and the Israeli socio-religious complexity, while in my opinion reading about the Mideast's history may be helpful, in addition to some classical music knowledge at least to know that Pachelbel's CaNon doesnt include any firing of any caNNon.

I think i only have one big brand cable in all my gear and that was a gift.The cable works as expected. the price was right. end of story.,1

4386,"Disappointing followup to horror classic ""Suspiria"": Apart from one knockout horror sequence (with the heroine swimming in an underwater chamber) this movie never really catches fire. The performances are very poor, in marked contrast to Suspiria. The music is also strangely sedate for a horror film, also in contrast to Suspiria. The look of the film partly makes for the lack of real horror, but only in certain spots. Overall a disappointment.",0
4387,"Great set: These bottles are the only ones that my daughter will take. The day she came home we started useing the Avent system but started using these once my milk came in because we didn't have to transfer the milk into Avent bottles after being pumped. From then on it has been smooth sailing... the nipples are really soft and flexible, the hole is on the top of the nipple so she doesn't get squirted in the back of the throat and choke. I do have a few complaints though, I agree that the ""sealing disk"" are a silly thing, I ended up only using the whole caps. Also, the nipples only come (as far as I know) in ""slow flow"" and my daughter sucks so hard that the nipple will sometimes go from round to flat because she creates so much suction on it. Other than that, they are the only bottles my ""bottle snob"" will currently take.",1

4390,"Acceptance, Enjoyment, Enthusiasm: The author's recommendations - acceptance, enjoyment, & enthusiasm - seem to diminish in that order in differentiating between someone who finds a new purpose in living and someone who is devoted to a selfish and materialistic lifestyle. Granted that ""acceptance"" is crucial at the gateway to a new inner self. But the latter two traits can be equally applicable to pursuing a materialistic lifestyle. Perhaps a more distinctive approach following acceptance would be ""others-centeredness"" and ""personal satisfaction."" Acceptance seems the hardest challenge in a materialistic society. Once we accept our existence, we must realize that our purpose in life on earth is to care for others. In our materialistic society, an equally difficult challenge is to shift our focus to the welfare of others. But it is through this effort that we realize enjoyment, satisfaction of purpose, and self-worth. And enthusiasm then comes naturally.Love and Immortality: Long Journey of My Heart",0

If you itemize and get a state refund, it cannot tell you if you should include in your income. Instead, it sends you to IRS web site to download form 525 and do it yourself.2. If you trade stock a lot, the cost base calcualtor froze up before I was half through. I end up using excel to do the cost base calculation and enter the final number in the turbo tax.3. It is worse if you own LU because it spin off AV and AGR. The word ""spinoff"" cannot be found in the topic list. As always, you can go to IRS web site.I am not sure if there are other tax software outthere that is better, I am certainly will NOT buy turbo tax next year.",0

Harr demonstrates a strong ability to weave many interesting and little known facts about the Revolutionary War, Benedict Arnold and many other historical figures into a well-written and, at times, suspenseful work of fiction. Further, as some other reviewers have noted, Dark Eagle is rich in visual imagery that makes you feel you are right in the middle of the action. Dark Eagle should find a large audience among those who are fans of books about history, war and even suspense.",1

I also can't comprehend how the same company that brought us the elegant and timeless Diablo II came out with this wretched, sloppy mess.

4401,"What's the 'bloody' point?: The prose is excellent, the characters very convincing, and the descriptive narrative is truly atmospheric. You really feel as though you have entered a living, breathing world in this novel. So why the hideous, quite pointles violence for scene after scene after scene? Is it just some immature impulse on the author's part to see how disgusting he can be? Is it an attempt to out-do the Bret Easton Ellises of this world? It's a shame that such an obviously talented author stoops to such repulsive imagery - the novel would have worked perfectly well without it. The concept of decency seems to have disappeared from modern American writing - apparently not even the finest luminaries are immune. I can hardly bear to say it, but if you think a work which features graphic descriptions of infants' heads being smashed open across rocks is still literature, then read it. Otherwise, there's really something lacking in someone who can publish this stuff without embarrassment.",0

It seemed more real than any other novel I've read in years.This story seems so real, and is so fast paced, I read it in a matter of hours over only two days. It terrified me in a way no other book ever has. Greg Bear wrote perhaps the best alien-invasion novel ever.And I wouldn't say the ending is dues ex machina. Yes, the cavalry comes -- but to what effect? I don't want to spoil the end, but suffice to say, Bear doesn't wimp out at any point, and pulls few punches... if any.Get it.

This book gives very very brief explanations with big text fonts and big pictures (not much meat) of how things work so don't hope to perform any actual work by following the book. If you just want to know how cars work and don't wish to perform any actual work then this book may be is for you. I highly recommend the dummy book and forget about this book if you do plan to perform work on your car. The dummy book has a lot more details and it actually shows you how to do the work.

I expected to be sick of it in about a month, but I only paid $9.99 so that was okay. Wow, was I wrong! This Cd really changed my life. It made me see myself and everything in new ways. Nearly every song impacted me at a different time over the last year and a half. I can listen to it all the way through and depending on my mood one of the songs will definetly grab me! I disagree with the last reviewer on which are the best and worst songs, but agree with the fact that they are all solidly good songs that could easily stand on there own. The first time I really listened to the 9/11 song I was touch.

4417,"Alternatingly funny and idiotic: At 1st I really liked this book. I related to the main character's feelings towards men and love. But then she was smoking pot & talking about how great it felt. She said she thought sex was special, but she went into detail about her 2 one-night stands.

I use that description to help me in a far number of cases. The Digital Atlas gave the ages in months too (e.g. 155 months) as compares to XX years XX months, which I did not like.

It was bad enough without Keith (even Pete has said so many times), but now without John as well?

It is absolutely criminal to charge such an exhorbinant amount of money for 50 cents worth of material. It makes me wonder if college profs, along with the authors of these textbooks are staying within the bounds of America's anti-trust laws. It would seem to me that the price of the book has been inflated beyond what any rational person without a class would pay for it. Here's a theory for you. The college profs and authors of the textbooks have a pact. You require the book that I write and I'll require yours. Then we both charge triple what it's worth and run with the money. Next year we print a twenty-fifth edition simply by changing the chapter order and make out with a steal again. This is rediculous. If it can be prooved a lawsuit is pending.",0

I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers. Ward Bond also. There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering.,0

While the book is filled with interesting facts (perhaps too many), I was disappointed by the lack of plot and character development. I found the storyline to be very disjointed. There are scores of superfluous minor characters who show up briefly and then disappear. And, when minor characters do reappear (like her sisters via correspondence), I just didn't care. It was as if the author were trying to cram too many vignettes and too many characters into this first novel. More often than not, I wondered why the characters were there at all. Even the main characters were relatively unsympathetic. The book didn't come together for me at all. I found it a very unsatisfying read.",0

4498,"You don't have to have sex to be a slut!: Tanenbaum brilliantly examines how being called a slut has nothing to do with sexual activity. It is the chosen insult of those who see a woman stepping out of her presumed role: be it beauty, culture, dating, etc. A woman can go out on multiple dates and be branded a slut, or can be a virgin who doesn't dress appropriately but is disliked by others and therefore is branded a slut for convenience. Tanenbaum brings in important examples such as the Spur Possee and the Glen Ridge, NJ rape of a mentally retarded girl to explores how assumptions about masculinity and femininity feed this process. When people think calling someone a slut is harmless they are wrong. However, she makes it clear that none of the women who's stories she tells are victims, they triumped!",1

It takes unnecessary effort to figure out the dimensions of matrixes and vectors. After all the torture, I cannot find a tiny bit of physical meaning attached behind. The problems are remotely connected with the text. I cannot do the problems after I read the text twice, or I cannot even understand what the problems are talking about.

4509,"A good review for this unfairly berated technical marvel: I guess I have been a little more fortunate with my watch. I bought mine when they first came out as it was the most technically advanced time piece out there. Still is, I think. This was 7 years ago. Never had a problem with it and the battery is only the second installed. I have just recently had an issue, but that's because I had welded the (-) button shut. I'm a metal sculptor and I never take the watch off my wrist. I disassembled it myself, including removing the button and replacing it. I fixed the button but now I have lost the Alt, and the temp is fixed at 190 degrees. I believe they are sensitive to the movement inside being fiddled with or jostled. There are some really tiny connectors to the touch crystal.I have swam with it, welded with it, beat the living crap out of it, and it lasted this long without a problem. Hopefully they will ruggedize the internals a little more. There just isn't a more advanced watch out there.",1

4524,"Nice Natural Taste: While not quite as good as theBlueberry, this bar still had a great natural taste that satisfies my sweet tooth. Compared to the blueberry, the cherry flavor was not as crunchy as I would expect of a ""fruit and nut"" bar, and was also more tart than I expected of a cherry flavor. However, still very delicious and worth giving a try.",1
4525,"A great gift: Bought this as a Christmas present and did not even have to wrap it. The box is very impressive and the Bracelet itself is very nice. My mom liked it a lot, its a great gift to show you appreciate your mom (not just on mothers day). A Great buy.",1

4528,"Gone astray...: Poor Mr Herbert. How far are the times of ""Dune""...This novel is based on a paper-thin plot, with an insufficient character development, an excruciatingly slow pace and no particularly interesting ""galactic"" order.The main character is unfortunately as cardboard as a Campbellian SF hero and the other characters are not much better.Another main race besides humans, the batrachian-like Gowachin, is described with few details, and thus their behaviour appears most of the time rather inexplicable.The conclusion is as foggy as the whole novel, with lots of subplots still pending (hopefully no sequel is planned).I did like very much Herbert's early work, but this novel is definitely below par, as it does not achieve ""suspension of disbelief"". Not recommended.",0

There are others out there like it, but not with the same flow rate. My wife and kids all noticed the change in flow rate when I switched to another filter and then back to the GE filter.I think that its worth the few extra bucks and they occasionally go on sale on Amazon, so you can get them at a good price and free shipping.",1
4531,"70's Backlash...or just plain bad?: There was a back lash in the 70's to such things as Vietnam--Civil rights etc. and America wanted to feel better about itself--protest songs were out, singer songwriters were in--it started with the likes of James Taylor and Bread and quickly evolved into a whole format of radio called MOR (middle of the road). Hmmm. A dubious moniker indeed. By the end of the 70's this singer song writer craze had disentigrated into the likes of Air Supply and you guessed it England Dan and John Ford Coley among others. This is typical overwrought self indulgent 70's pap. Not only is it extremely dated it is trite and truly awful. There's no David Gates here to save it from it's sugary self. This was 70's MOR ... and I for one am glad that it is long gone.......and by the way is England actually his name, or just a cool nickname?",0

I would not reccommend this pump.",0
4533,"A great DVD, great sound.: This DVD is well worth the money. I've seen them live and actually walked out because the performance was very dismal and the sound was terrrible. Florida 1985, what was I expecting?This DVD has great sound and shows the band as best as can be expected. The layering of images does get annoying but does stays true to the their psychadelic style. They really manged to get a great recording from a live performance. As for the Tom Petty comment, you really should get your hearing checked, LOL.",1
4534,"An embarrassment: I very much enjoyed Carr's earlier novels. It's hard to believe he wrote this one, and harder still to believe it made it through an editor to see the light of day as a published hardcover.This reads like a bad Tom Clancy (if that's not too much of a tautology). There is a complete lack of character development and motivation.I groaned through half of this drivel and have put it aside. Life is too short to waste valuable time reading this cartoonish nonsense.",0
4535,"for commercial applications: I have done household and small commercial applications for 20+ years. I have recently been hired by a commercial refrigeration company. While I have not read the entire book it appears to be quite a comprehensive volume for commercial applications. Useful to make the transition I require. It is very helpful in answering my questions and providing additional information on the systems/components/effects/problems/reasons I am being introduced to on the job. Some of the details on each subject seem to be helpful to the professionals I work with. As one of the reviewers (who gave a one star rating) stated: all professionals should already have this knowledge. However, if I were a business owner I would want all my techs to have a copy of this book to speed the diagnosis and proper solution for the system's failure as opposed to simply replacing the failed part. (It seems to me the above mentioned reviewer should write his own book...I'd buy it).",1
4536,"Too Tight and not the best sound: I found the Sony MDR-V150 Headphones to be too tight for my head, and I believe many other reviewers share the same view as me. After 15-20 minutes of use, I had to remove them because of the growing pressure against my ears. I ended up with a splitting headache after I used these headphones. And what's more, the sound quality isn't that great either.And I'm not comparing these with in-ear iPod headphones. I'm comparing the Sony ones with on-ear headphones of other make. For example, I previously owned one made by Panasonic, and the sound quality was superb and it was very comfortable to have over your ears. Even the Bose on-ear regular headphones are comfortable and provide good quality sound, although those are a lot more expensive.",0

4539,"terrible product and not worth listening to at any price.: This DVD may be good as a CD but not as a DVD. The format is two women talking with each other. One of the women has her back to the camera. There is no action or visuals of any kind except for the two women talking. They do not use microphones. The camera is stationary and set up at a distance from the women so that the whole picture of the women can be included. The only microphone is the microphone attached to the camera. Because of the distance, the woman facing the camera is difficult to hear but the woman with her back to the camera/microphone cannot be heard at all. The higher the volume is turned up, the greater the background noise.This might have been much better as a CD where the women would each have a microphone and the listener would be able to have a clear understanding of their topic.",0

The images of Twinings tea tins do not possess the strength rating, however, when I received my tins they both had three tea leaf strengths on the front of the tin. I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea. Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images. Similarly, written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system. This should also be corrected. My supplier's and Amazon's processing were both superlative.",0

I, on the other hand, cannot get the taste out of my own mouth and I washed my hands after using it. BLECH! Works great on humans, awful for my cat! What a waste!",0

4549,"Disappointed: Decided to replace my old P4 Squirt after many years of reliable service. I thought the new E4 would be more in line with the way I actually use my Leatherman. My very first cut with the knife blade was a piece of rubber tubing. As I pressed down to make the cut, the blade bent back past its lock, permanently deforming it and making the blade useless. I have abused my old P4 far worse with no ill effects. I begin to wonder if the quality is not as good as it used to be. I guess I'll be going back to my old P4 until I can decide what to do.",0
4550,"Slow, but worth it: This is perhaps the slowest moving movie I've ever seen. I don't think many people would like to sit down and watch it with you, but it's worth watching. I was really happy with it. I can't say much more than that without spoiling it. But if you're looking for a movie to watch with friends, watch something else. It reminds me a lot of ""The Stranger"" by Albert Camus if it could be made into a movie.",1

So i'm giving her two stars even though I would just given her one if this were to stand on its own, because knowing Ani, this is probably just a lull.",0

I went to the cable store.. Baught an additional remote, and it's just like having another box.. Aiming wise.. I have no problems. Set up wise.. literly 5 minutes..

Hence, when my gf is over and we don't agree on what we're watching, both sets are tuned into that box, however the occational dvd can mediate this.. 10/10 rating.. does exactly what it supposed to for me.. no aiming issues. easy to set up! -Zack NJ",1

4556,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!: What an adventure! A fun book to read that is also uplifting and inspirational! There were so many fascinating ideas to explore and such an exciting story wrapped around those ideas that I couldn't put it down! This book takes you into an exploration of consciousness and teaches you various techniques along the way. I have been on a spiritual path for over 25 years and still found interesting new thoughts in this book. This is a MUST READ book for anyone hoping that we can heal ourselves and the planet.

The sound isn't near the quality of 100$+ sets, but they're good enough. Basically, they're great for bass heavy music, but they lack treble power and control.If you're just starting out in the audiophile world, these are a great start.",1

A quick flip through would have revealed that most of the five star ratings come from fellow Derby skaters and fans, and, sure, I can see how this would be a great read for them.But once the successful formation of the new league has been covered, the book wallows around in mundane details that weren't really of very much interest to the average civilian. Pre-game playlists? Favorite rollergirl names? Different personae? Eh.This ain't Friday Night Lights. More's the pity.",0
4564,"I really disliked it: I just finished ""winter garden"" a few weeks back and was thrilled to find out a new Ashworth book was coming out, but this was not what I was expecting. The entire jaw bone plot was really silly, as other reviewers mentioned it made no sense that Ned would be disgraced by someone stealing the jaw, nor did it make any sense the *revenge* Ned intended. And for me, this plot was boring as sin. What was the urgency? It wasn't like Ned was a spy or a ambassador, we all have our personal career setbacks but the book made it like it was a devistating loss on par with losing a limb.Then I found the romance dull and lifeless as well. I could see little reason for the pair to fall in love. I didn't even make it to the last chapter which, I was shocked to discover, I wasn't too disappointed about. I hate to give a bad review, but this one really should be skipped.",0

This is much more than Limp Bizkit garbage, these guys actually have lyrics that are...somewhat meaningful. The idea of having two vocalists sets this band away from the crowd, both vocalists are good, and they both have different strengths and weaknesses, which makes this album rare in the fact it has good rap AND good screaming in it. One thing about rap rock that is dissapionting is some vocalists can be great singers, but their rapping voice is horrible, which can greatly degrade an otherwise decent album. All of the songs on this CD are at least decent, except I really dislike track 10. Besides that, this is a great CD and it can be enjoyed by alot of people.",1

The 1st disk is called the ""on-ramp"" before the lessons on discs 2 - 4.It really seemed to me that discs 2 - 4 might have been the concept for the package and somebody said, ""this is too hard, let's add an introductory disk"". The english-speaking narrator and the spanish speakers are different from from disk 1 to disk 2 as well, lending support to my theory.

4596,A mistake to buy this cable: I purchased this cable new to go with my new hdtv. It worked fine for six weeks until I could not get a picture. I mess with the cable and get an off color picture on the screen. I mess with the cable more and it worked for two days. Now it gets a wobbly picture on the screen which I cannot get rid of. I never moved the xbox but it just started happening for no reason. What a waste of money for over priced cables.I would spring for the extra ten bucks and get the monster cables at least you have a far less chance of dealing with the mess I have. I have had great luck with monster in the past but was too cheap and decided to trust microsoft.Note: I bought the microsoft vga cable at a local store and the picture was horrible and might as well have been the lowest end. If you have hdtv then steer clear of anything less than component cables (monster). It is amazing the difference in quality. Also it was stupid of microsoft not to include an hdmi connection for the 360.,0

With pieces like ""The Angel is MyWatermark"", a hilarious self-portrait of Miller in Parissuffering an excess of artistic inspiration, to a tenderreminiscence of his father's New York tailor shop, thisbook contains a side to Henry Miller rarely seen throughthe publicity but known to his careful readers; a sidethat is philosophical, spiritual, and funny.

NOT IN THIS CASE. This is the lovely exception, signature dishes from a great restaurant that are replicable by competent home cooks. And, these are clever, inventive dishes that make the most out of their combination of ingredients. Underneath it all is the soul of farmstead cooking overlaid with imagination and professionalism.

We found the book to be a major disappointment.The authors have an argument to make, but the quality of their qualitative and quantitative evidence is at best uneven. The survey analysis seldom includes multivariate tests and the interview sources, while extensive, are episodically not comprehensively analyzed. By the end of the book, we had little confidence that the conclusions the authors presented were well supported by their evidence.It's a readable book, but it is difficult to put much faith inits conclusions.",0
4610,"Bad from start to finnish.: His jokes are awful. He starts up one idea, (ie: Jakie Chan plays very similar characters in all his movies.) and then proceeds to do a stereotypical Asian accent where he states what he is doing as he plays Jakie Chan. And it goes on, and on, and on, and on for like 15 min +. What he is doing is not funny, original, fresh or new, and he simply assumes if he moves more, and yells louder it will become funny. BTW, this is his whole act. The majority of his jokes make fun of Asian people. Now I don't want it to seem like I did not think it was funny because I was offended. I love controversial humor....

But is the mysterious stranger Brandon Nichols really a messenger from God? Or is his power from another source?The novel is deeply layered and is predominantly told in the first person narrative from Travis's point of view. We learn of Travis's early life in the ministry, his adolescence and young adulthood and how those events have shaped him into the man he is today.The ending is a bit implausible and somewhat slow in coming, but it's a good read nonetheless.",1

Okay, lets say that you are not familiar to any of the directors in the book and you read a review and check out the film and you love what you see. You will probably want to check out other pieces of work by this same director. Unfortunately the Videohound World Cinema book does not list all of the works of cool foreign directors, even of films made outside the U.S. For example, David Cronenberg has a wimpy film list in the back of the book with a mere three films. The book has completely overlooked great campy Italian horror directors like Lucio Fulci. What I am saying is that the book is far from complete and needs a whole lot of additions.

It is always funny to me (being a reseller) that Trekkies will not buy Star Trek stuff if it is next to Star Wars stuff and vice versa. So the scene in the film where some trekkies go into the (Windows?) comic book store and want to know the price of a Star Trek Phaser, really hit home with me.There are tons of other great scenes that also caught my eye , but I do not want to spoil it.

We took it to Nepal for a 24-day trek, and the lens cover stopped working at all about mid-way through the trip.Another significant problem we had was that it went through batteries at the rate of almost 2 per day by the 1st week of the trip. I can't tell you how much of a problem this was. We brought home a huge pile of batteries to recycle, while all of our friends (who were using much bigger and more complex cameras) went through 1 to 2 sets of batteries each. This is a seriously flawed camera, and we will be returning it pronto.",0

Add some oil and fry stuff, and forget it. My advice: money spent better elsewhere.",0

4665,"Ridiculous junk: It is bad enough that any printer manufacturer would offer a laser printer these days with a measly 1 MB of standard memory but it is [bad] that they would make 1 MB the maximum amount of memory that printer can accomodate. If you ever want to print anything other than text (such as .pdf files, graphics intensive web sites, digital photos) stay away from this unit. I would strongly reccomend the Brother HL-1440. It comes with 2 MB standard and is upgradable to 34 MB using a standard SIMM. It also has many other other advantages over the HP at a lower price. If you really have your heart set on HP but don't want to spend a lot, you'd be A LOT better off to buy a higher line model used or refurbished. HP seems to be using its reputation for high quality office grade machines to fool home users into buying complete junk.",0

In no way whatsoever does this movie continue or build on the plot of the first one. If you try to watch the 2 movies one after the other, you will be confused and unimpressed. However, as long as you take this movie strictly on it's own merits, and do not try to tie it into the first one, it is definitel;y a good movie. It is unfortunate that the producers chose to include the ""Omega Code"" in the title, but for reasons of their own they did. If you have not seen the first Omega Code at all, or for quite a while, you will enjoy this movie as well.",1

It could have been better.But after reading some of the others after book 14, it definately could have been much worse.The cover art is wonderful here. And the book, reminiscent of Book #2, God of Death, but not nearly as good, is still a crowning achivement in historical adventure.Casca fans just want more action and adventure, watching to see how many ways Casca can die, only to come back to bloody life. Well worth your time.",1
4670,"KitchenAid Coffee Grinder Eval: After wearing out several low cost units by makers, such as Black and Decker, etc. I opted to pay a bit more and purchase a heavy duty type. The KitchenAid unit is well suited for daily use. I really appreciate the fact that the grinder bowl separates from the power base, similar to a blender, so that you can dump the grounds without having to unplug the unit.The thick plastic cover/dome reduces the sound from the grinding somewhat which my pets appreciate.The power of the KitchenAid unit is great and I don't anticipate wearing out the motor, as I did in the B&D; unit.Overall, this unit is well worth the additional cost, plus if you have other KitchenAid devices, matching form factors is a nicety.",1

She loves baby dolls and has been thrilled with this center. Even her four-year-old sister (who is not into baby dolls) enjoys it and uses it to groom and wash her stuffed puppy dogs! I like the way it allows one child to use one side while another child can use the other side (less fighting over space). It is sturdy enough that it doesn't fall over on her and light enough that it is easy for me (mom) to move around when needed. It works well in my daughter's small room - I like the way it combines so many baby care items (i.e. changing table, cabinet, bath, and high chair) into one compact unit. I would definitely recommend to my friends!",1
4673,"One Thing only: One Thing makes the cd. Pretty much everything is plastic eighties music, very synthetic and not very pure. This is an early version of the band, so I can't knock it too bad. For this cd to have such a high rating is unforgiveable, though. It's pretty bland for the most part with two standout songs. Much better things come from this band. Basically, it's a bunch of rubbish sandwiched between One Thing and Don't Change, which are excellent songs. You can bypass this one. You can buy pretty much any other cd from this band and come out a winner. This one just isn't that good.",0

With very few exceptions, this film seems to demonize people against same sex marriage and legalizing marijuana while it glorifies those in favour of it. It reminded me a lot of a Michael Moore documentary attempting to swing the political vote without giving a fair chance for BOTH sides to explain their side without making one side look 'cool' and the other look like a vicious lynch mob.It also seemed very anti-Christianity regarding the same sex marriage issue as the film's examples of people against same sex marriage were church goers and pastors.I hate ignorance regardless of what the views are.

His latest single still shows he has the classic feeling he used to have back in the 80's. Black Sweat, the second single from his recently released 3121 album, is one of the most infectious tracks Prince has recorded in years. The song is very upbeat and incredibly delightful for not just die hard Prince fans, but also for anybody who hasn't even heard a classic track from this Soul legend. I absolutely love this guilty pleasure track, and it is purely sweatting out for everyone.Song: B+",1

The Andersons went on from this to live action shows, and I do have a soft spot as well for both _Stingray_ and _Fireball XL-5_ before this, and _UFO_ and _Space: 1999_ after, but _Thunderbirds_ remains at the top of the heap.

Everything is way beyond exaggerated and inflamed. Too much of good sound sometimes can go overboard, and that's exactly what happened here. Every tune is very unique and so fat (full) that instead of balanced mix there is a struggle for a better space.Not to mention the selection of certain musicians with so much amazing music out there right now.

They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns.

Price helped me choose the Hauppauge with the understanding that if it didn't work out well then I would work on obtaining the XBox.The Media MVP was easy to set up (except that my network cable was bent, but one could hardly blame Hauppauge for that). Load the s/w, plug in the cable and away I went. As others have noted, the interface is dreadful. The interface looks like it would integrate well into the Atari game boxes of the 80's - boxy, low-res and unattractive.

And there are very few scriptural citations. I'm not Jewish and I knew more about Judaism than what's in this book before I got my Master's in Jewish Studies.

Although I did agree with him about: why Triple H is not as good as he used to be; Owen Hart's senseless death; and that Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle (among others) are awesome wrestlers--I strongly disagree with his assessments of Shawn Michaels (who is my favorite wrestler EVER) and other wrestlers too numerous to list here. I agree with another reviewer who said he really needs to get over the Montreal screwjob and realize that Michaels has really changed for the better.

4731,"AMAZING PRODUCT: I received a pasta roller/cutter for Christmas and, after experiencing how well it worked, I purchased this companion set to go along with it. I cannot say enough good things about this product!!! If you follow the pasta recipes included (and the noodle recipe was almost identical to our own ""family recipe"") you should have equally amazing results! My husband is a professional baker and just stood there watching in disbelief at how well it rolled the dough (original purchase item) and cut the pasta to perfection. We have large family gatherings and I am always responsible for making the noodles; this year my niece thought I'd taken the easy way out and bought the noodles because they looked so perfect!",1

4733,"just another story...: I must say that I was highly disappointed with this book. McLinden's writing style was fine, and the book was an easy read, but her problems hardly seemed rare at all. While I'm sure her intention was to write a book that others could relate to, I found her words whiney and at times, annoying. It was almost as though she seemed to be over-exaggerating her problems and trying to get more attention. ...",0
4734,"Miles Smiles: I was surprised to see so little written about this fine recording. I listen to it often and consider it to be one of my best purchases. The sound is crisp and clear and some of the tracts are live [So What and All Blues]. Wallace Roney sounds just like Miles, maybe a bit cleaner. Wayne Shorter is always present to balance the trumpet with his tenor and soprano sax. Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams balance it all out. Give this a listen if you want to hear some fine musicians in peak form.",1
4735,"THe Brethren: I read this book on a plane ride to England. While it comforted me the entire flight, I found the plot predictable and couldn't wait to be done with it. At times I was intrigued by the intersection of the two story plots but by the middle of the book, it was not difficult to resolve what was going to happen. NOt one of his best works but an ok read to pass time.",0
4736,"Overhyped, Underwritten: With the plot device of 'virtual reality made real' (don't ask) the sky was potentially the limit for the writers. But after the first hour or so of interesting but too numerous and convoluted twists, the film devolved into a very prolonged shoot-em-up/kung-fu show down. What a waste. It took me half a dozen sittings over several weeks just to get through it because it became so mind numbingly boring and predictable. If slick special effects and gunplay are all you need in a movie then go for it. Personally I'd rather watch my lawn grow.",0

The guide, in and of itself, is not the whole answer to managing organizational change.

At the very least users of the guide will not re-invent the wheel, or worse spin their own wheels trying to get their minds wrapped around how to manage a situation.",1

As the title indicates, it is a Celtic fantasy, not a re-creation of Celtic music, that Davidson has set out to produce. With strings and keyboards and synths, his violin being the chief solo voice, he has produced what seems to be a soundtrack in search of a film, which makes this music not quite movie music, either.

Any body can have this sound with a great engineer and little experience with insturments(BAND). The electronic beats with indie music has been done. Please try the ""ANNIVERSARY"" for more heart felt lyrics and just plain better electro-pop. The Anniversary has the most heart felt lyrics that are genious.Just cause wherer i live the postal service is number 1 on the radio deosn't mean its good music.

I checked out this book from my school's library for my book report on whether or not said book of my choosing is considered seriously literature. Spoiler alert: It's not. At all.

At first I was interested in Wolfe's funereal tone and odd subject matter, but after 800 pages, I'm sorry to inform you, you won't find out whether the world got saved or not. The hope of at least a bit of plot resolution was the only thing that kept me going to the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.If you like Wolfe's books or writing for themselves, that's fine, I'm not criticizing you, but the first time reader has a right to know that many people (including many people who enjoy other difficult and demanding works) don't feel the way you do.Instead, or in addition, please read John Crowley's ""Little, Big,"" or Steven Erikson's Malazan books, starting with ""Gardens of the Moon.""

What I wanted was a book to lay it on the line, and cover the subject quickly.

A relatively poorly developed plot line, and from what I've read in other reviews, doesn't matchup to the original story lines much at all (I personally had never heard of Jonah Hex before the movie).But what I found incredibly frustrating and ultimately annoying was that there was over 12 minutes of trailers and advertisements for other DC Comic related stuff that the DVD would not let fast forward or menu out of. Completely unacceptable. If I thought I could pin point which part of the responsible parties were responsible for that, I'd be sure to never buy any of there products in the future.",0

Additionally, the red stoppers on the bottom of the handlebars have to be turned out every time you want to fold the stroller up for storage or in when you want to place the car seat on the stroller.

4804,"MILDLY ENTERTAINING..............JUST ADD WATER!: I caught this film on the MGM HD channel and it looked great. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make this a great film. This film was OK and had some unintentional funny moments to keep my interest. It's kind of a mummy variation, sort of, at least the idea.....a little. one of the funniest parts of the movie is this ""faceless man"" is slow! and couldn't catch a cold let alone get close enough to anyone to kill them! If you remember the Mummy films from Universal's 40's series you know what I mean(RIGHT CB? :-D), but at least in those films the Mummy would kind of sneak up to his victims and then grab them. In this film I laughed out loud as this creature movie at a glacier's pace across the room as a woman droped to the ground in horror waiting to be murdered. Hysterical! I don't know about the DVD, but this film is mildly entertaining at best. I wouldn't waste my money on it.",0
4805,Not as good as they say: I ran the games in this book through Fritz and they are ripe with bad moves. There is little explanation given. Most of the information is suppose to be understood already. This isn't a good book for newcomers. I'm not new to chess and I have learned more from other books than from this one. I'm not here to tell you what books to get but there are better ones out there.,0

It's not the same anymore. They changed the ingredients/formula. Its very disappointing because the old formula worked wonders. The new formula sucks! It doesn't detangled nor moisturizer as well...and it seems I have to use a lot more than I have with the old formula. Anyway, if you can find the old formula with (oils) instead of aloe vera gel in the new formula, I highly recommend to buy it! Dont waste your money on this one.",0

4808,"ELEMENTS OF LEADERSHIP UNCOVERED: Mr. Pressfield's book ""Gates of Fire"" should be made required reading in every US Military Academy, and Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer professional development course. The story is engrossing in itself, but the real value here is the way Mr. Pressfield uncovers those traits that separate warriors from run-of-the-mill militia. Told from the point of view of Xeones, the lone Spartan survivor of the battle at Thermopylae, the story winds flawlessly through the major events that lead Xeones into his final battle. Beginning with his home city falling to traitorous allies, and his subsequent fight for survival with his cousin and uncle, to his arrival at the ""agoge"" (Spartan military academy), we are given a view of the lives of some of history's most impressive warriors. Better still, we are treated to insights into the Greek mind and learn what made the Spartans such exceptional leaders, tacticians and soldiers.",1
4809,"Over-hyped: I agree with other reviewers who mention Smith's lack of focus in writing the story and lack of compassion for the characters. It reads like the work of a twenty-something with limited life experience who is overly proud of herself and just can't be bothered to get anything right. Flip judgments of characters don't make for an entertaining or compelling read. This is one to avoid, despite the opinions of reviewers obsessed with the writer's youth and good looks. It's a look, not a book.",0

4811,"put a leash on fred: Limp Bizkit is the band you hate to love. Basically, my thoughts on this CD is that it's at its best when Fred keeps himself restrained and sings decent lyrics, as in ""My Way"", or ""The One"", which is a great mellow track which follows the footsteps of ""Rearranged""...The annoyance comes in when Fred proudly announces that he has used the word f$#k 46 times, mocks NIN lyrics,(Hot Dog), or repeats the name of his band (just about every song) in case you didn't know it. There are some truly grating raps in ""Full Nelson"" and ""Livin' it Up,"" and this is a recurring theme throughout, but ""Rollin'"" rides a guitar riff so powerful it overcomes the nonsense. I still give it four stars because the band consistently rocks like few others today. Significant Other, however, will in the end stand as the better album and a signpost of the times.",1
4812,"I'm a fan: I was introduced to Karl Jenkins through his commercial music for Delta Airlines and DeBeers Diamonds, although I didn't know that he was the composer. After I went to a very moving live performance of The Armed Man, I started browsing his video clips on YouTube. The Essential Collection kept popping up, so I bought the CD. I think I might wear it out from playing it so often. This is an eclectic sampling of his music, which ranges from the unabashedly joyful to the scarily ominous. I am now a committed Karl Jenkins fan.",1

Probably NOT, not a good choice. They would be clearly biased and would have an agenda, right?This is a well researched book, but with an anti-Muslim agenda. It's like a Jew writing about the life of Jesus, but denying his divinity; that would be biased as well. If you're seeking to read biased information this is the right book for you, BUT if you REALLY WANT TO LEARN more about one of the great World religions (in America we need to learn more about other religions) don't waste your money and time.

It took a while to fully get into the story and I did not think the plot or action moved along enough, but am interested to see what happend to the cahracters in book 2.

After that, Abel gets stuck in an island. How does he go home?... In my opinion, Abel's Island is funny,fun and exciting. So Abel's Island is the best. You should read this book because the book is wonderful, funny, fun, exciting and teaches you a lesson. I give this book a 5 star because it is fabulous. Also, the pictures are helpful, that's because if there is a hard word, the picture helps you. The cat wanted to eat Abel but Abel climbed the tree. What happens?

I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves. It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her. I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate.

It help us a lot in trying to get the snow out of the walkway and driveway. I just had to lift it to be able to remove snow almost two feet high. Others say it was hard to put the handle on but really you just have to use your common sense. Once you figure it out it was easy to assemble. Good for the price we paid.

We returned it and purchased a Canon which had much better clarity. Meanwhile, my sister purchased the Sony Cybershot and I noticed all of her photos lacked clarity as mine had.

It does a great job of controling all my equipment.My complaints are just a couple. I do not like the number pad all the way at the bottom. The remote could be laid out better ergonomically speaking. The only other complaint is the plastic case that houses the remote. It is very slippery and the remote tends to want to slide out of your hands, especially now in the colder months here in the North East your hands tend to be dry this time of year and this further complicates the problem.",1

Not only am I sorely disappointed (this is my first problem I have ever had with any Belkin product) but I am disgusted that when I pressed one for English, the guy on the other end of the line couldn't understand a simple question about what the developers were putting together for all of us that either did not try Vista and went straight to 7 or used Vista for all of 2 months and said, WTF is this and upgraded to Windows 7.

Its layout is perfect and intuitive. It's inexpensive enough that I have bought one for each TV/cable box/DVD setup in the house keeping operation consistant for the family members. The only negative is the heavily used buttons wear out after 1-2 years of operation. But at the price that's not a big deal. I hope they keep making this one a long time.,1
4864,"Sutherland is wonderful!: Beatrice di Tenda is one of Bellini's most under rated operas. It was written right after Norma and right before I Puritani, his two greatest masterpieces. Unfortunatly, after a poor reception at its opening it was never really given many chances to catch up with its sisters. It was only after Sutherland gave these historic performances in the early 1960's that the opera was re-born. Today it is a rare opera to hear but a treasure to listen to if ever given the opportunity. This recording is terrific, Sutherland is in top form. The only problem is the pace of this performance is too slow and just doesn't sound, to me, like true Bellini. Much better recording are with Joan Sutherland and Pavarti (1966 Decca). Or with June Anderson (opera d'oro 1987), either of these give Beatrice the proper seat beatween her sisters Norma and Elvira.",1

It was nice to read this book before I go to graduate school because now I know exactly what to expect.The quotes from students are very helpful and you get an honest opinion of what students are thinking about graduate school. It might have been nice to have a longer chapter about the application process itself, how the schools notify you if you'ce been accpeted, how long you should wait before you can assume you didn't get in etc. All in all though, this is a very informative book.

Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's.",1
4874,"Great: This is a really interesting album as a Built to Spill fan. It's obviously Doug Martsch, and his playing style plays through. There are a couple moments where the solos are all Doug the way we've come to love. What's intriguing about it, is that Doug fell in love with the blues. Where most people just say they wish they could play the blues, Doug has learned how, and has added a fantastic open tuned slide guitar to his arsenal of sounds. The album almost exclusively features this, and it's a fantastic modern take on the blues from a very Doug/Indie Rock viewpoint.",1
4875,"Sickening Content in a ""humor"" book: I throughly enjoyed her first book, and delved into the second with a good deal of anticipation.The book is well written, and worthwhile in many ways, but it is NOT lighthearted comedy. If you are looking for escapist light humor, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. I would have felt differently about this, perhaps, if I had had a glimmer of a warning of some of the subject matter. It certainly was a drastic departure from the content and tone of her first book.Imagine, if you will, expecting a light hearted romp of southern foibles, and then reading, in order, about rape, suicide, and then the murder of hamsters in a grisly fashion. Yech! I do not know what happened after that, the book is now in the trash, and I am a little sickened every time I think about it.",0

4879,"Excellent performance of th 7th.: While I think JPMARMARO has gone slightly overboard on this, it is indeed an excellent performance, particularly in the second movement, in which the multiple threads can be followed much more easily than is usually the case. The oboes do indulge in some excessive tremolo and the finale starts out a bit less vivace than it ought to, but almost everything else about this recording is first rate.",1

I don't know if the book is different from the movie, but I got to say that this book is completely unreadable! I wanna know what kind of ""substance"" the author of this novel was on when he wrote this rambling, confusing, and highly bizarre story! I found the main character Oskar to be incredibly annoying. This book made my head hurt and the weird, graphic photos was one of the main reasons I stopped reading this book. If you like confusing, contrived novels then this one is for you...if you don't then please pass on this one!",0

It was very hard to assemble and very cheaply made. The first time I put my 14-pound daughter in it it fell to one side because the height adjustment is weak. Just resting my arm on the tray caused the tray to pop off. I can only imagine how dangerous this chair would be when she is bigger and climbing, escaping, pounding her chair.",0
4889,Stale and tired.: After repeated attempts to get into St. Anger I have to admit I REALLY don't like anything on this record. We (and the band themselves) should accept the fact that Metallica are washed up.They sound like a broken down basement band devoid of creative fire and state of the art chops especially compared to new hungry outfits like Lamb of God for instance. That's not to say that a band of Metallica's stature should nessacarily be stacked up against other more recent bands who have youth and the benefit of building on the metal legacy Metallica themselves spearheaded but even on their own terms there is no excuse for putting out boring ill concieved and poorly executed material. Beyond a big let down more like the last straw. The best thing about St. Anger is the film Some kind of Monster which as it turns out is a sad documentation of a once powerful and relevant musical force who have not yet realized they should call it a day.,0

4896,Nothing Unifying Here: I bought this book with the hope of reading how top contemporary Protestant scholars address the issue of ecclesiology espoused by Rome and the Orthodox. It left me sadly disappointed. The chapter that addresses the four marks of the church defined in the nicene creed did not attempt to reconcile Protestant perceptions of those terms with the historical understanding of the council fathers. None dealt substantially with Eph 5:32. I was further saddened that one author criticized the piety of Catholics on the basis of his understanding rather than taking the time to just ask some of them why they were doing it. All guns trained against Catholicism while the Eastern Orthodox hold nearly identical views on ecclesiology. Perhaps someday a book with less rhetoric and polemic will attempt to address issues that build understanding rather than polarizing divisiveness.,0
4897,"Not genre defining, but its still a good book.: At first, I was a bit hesitant to pick the book up mainly because when a company decides to pick up a good license and try to convert it to a different medium, such as a movie, the results are less than spectacular. But at the price my local bookstore was selling it, I decided to pick it up and read it. It started off slow but it slowly becomes more exciting, as the author is able to give personality to the characters in the book, and at times even be attached to them, not to mention the story is well written and will make you want more. However, I agree with one of the reviews in that the use of the time portal to bring the characters into the past is a bit campy, but its existance is explained in that its a combination of the powers of the Well of Eternity and one of the Dragon aspects.Overall, its a very good book and I would recommend it to Warcraft and science fiction fans alike.",1
4898,"Not so HOT but good.: I plowed thru the first 150 pages. It was mean spirited and a downer. But after the setting was staged, things began to happen.This book is light (very) on romance which I have come to expect from Sandra Brown, but it certainly was better than some of her very corny romances.I am glad I stuck with the book because the conclusion and the last several chapters made it difficult for me to put down.Hello, Darkness was better but I enjoyed this one also.",1

Most are relatively easy and fast (especially the chapter on one-dish meals), and although some ingredients you have to look a little harder to find most are available and a lot are things you probably already have on hand. The Chicken Enchiladas and Garden Vegetable Pizza have become standard family favorites and when served to guests I am often asked for the recipes. Oh, and did I mention that the recipies are low fat? I often forget because they taste so good. So happy that she is coming out with another cookbook - I will be one of the first to buy it!",1

The self discharge rate is the worst I have ever seen. The dipstick girl I talked to at customer service says this is normal. She refused to honor the warranty stating that Duracell does not warranty the batteries when it comes to self discharge, so if they lose their power overnight,your screwed. No more Duracell in this family. They have no idea what a good customer they lost and it was obvious that Duracell customer service is non-extistent. Duracell has slowly gone downhill in the past couple of years. This recent experience just confirmed what I already knew. Dont buy the rechargeables.",0

It had a good set of songs, and the newer vesions of the classic PF songs(such as 'Comfortably Numb', and 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond') were performed outstandingly! 'Run Like Hell' was also good! The guitar solo's were really cool. One other nicely performed song was 'One Of These Days'. If I were to get another PF album, I would recommend 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder'. (which I already own)The only draw back is that David Gilmour's voice on a few of the songs were not 'that' good....no offence to David. But other than that...this is a 'Must Have'.",1

It's got tons of action, some very humorous moments (such as when Aya nails herself in the head with her own Yo-Yo), and a great story. Not to mention it's got the girls of our favorite J-Pop dynasty, Hello! Project. Aya Matsuura does great as Saki Asamiya and Rika Ishikawa is absolutely gorgeous as the main villainess. I just love that the creators took these very beautiful girls and inserted them into such a wonderful movie. I will have this DVD for sure!

4923,"excellent headphone for Dragon NaturallySpeaking: This wired headphone works better than the Plantronics wireless headphone works for use with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. The DSP-400 is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I have not had any pressure problems with it against my ears, as I have had with other headphones. Suggestions for improving construction: The wires are way too long (the photo of the item doesn't show how very long the wires are), and have to be carefully untangled before each use, and the small wires close to the headset should be covered with a sturdier plastic coating because they are too easily damaged and require extra care in handling. I've had two of these headsets stop working because of a break in the wire next to the the Digital Signal Processing unit and next to the in-line volumn control. I suggest the wires close to these areas be beefed up so they won't break inside the plastic wire covering because of the unavoidable movement of the wires through use.",1

If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem. Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed? What?!?! This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like ""girlfriends"" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent.

The problem with this film is that 1) I couldn't understand half of what Hoffman (as Capote) was saying. Hoffman may have his lisping, nasal, girlish speech down pat but that doesn't help the audience. Raising the volume didn't help a bit. The problem was with Capote's poor articulation and low speech intensity. 2) This really isn't very interesting. Story: writer/journalist crosses the line when it comes to ethics and objectivity in order to further his career. What a staggeringly novel concept!! And the story of a murder in Kansas is not international news - it's just a senseless murder in a little town. That Capote lost his objectivity when working on it should bring nothing but a big yawn since it has no historical importance. 3) This movie is dull.Don't waste your time.",0

By contrasting the financial principles he was taught by his rich dad to those of his poor dad, Kiyosaki manages to teach his reader the secrets of effective money management in an easy to understand and entertaining manner. Although Kiyosaki does make several specific recommendations, his primary emphasis is on general principles of creating wealth rather than the ""how-to"" approach of other books. The book also offers a large motivational benefit for anyone with an entrepreneurial interest. The one flaw in this book is that Kiyosaki advocates a relatively high-risk approach to money management that may not be suitable for every reader.",1

4944,Wrong product: I would have given this 5 stars because I love this knife for it's purpose. The problem was I was sent the zytel version when I ordered the anodized version. Excellent deployment and comes out of the box wicked sharp. Has to to be the sharpest knife Ive gotten out of the box. It's the invisible knife. I really cant believe how light this thing is.

4946,"Impressive: I'm always a major fan of Robert Jordan, and I beleive that this is one of his better books. With all around good plot, this book is self-sufficient. Addmittedly, there are a few weak points, but those are few, and involve the s of bad guys, a trivial matter. Though not the best book of the series, this is a great book. For readers of Terry Goodkind or JRR Tolkein, this series is a must.",1
4947,"Excellent Reference: I can't believe this book isn't in print anymore. This should be in every woodworker's book collection. This is not a DIY guide. It covers everything from design and science of doors including interior, exterior, and cabinet doors. I highly recommend this reference.",1

4949,"Good, but not great: I've been a Heather Nova fan for a few years now. I'm not a huge fan, but I've enjoyed her music for awhile. She has a great voice and her songs are normally wonderful. This album lived up to my expectations, but it didn't exceed them. It was similar to other ones I've heard by her, but it had enough of an extra something to make it stand out.""Welcome"" (which is not listed at this site, but is on my CD, anyway) is probably my favorite song on ""South."" It's very catchy without sounding like it was molded for MTV. I also love the songs ""Like Lovers Do"" and ""Virus Of The Mind."" The former is a nice, somewhat peaceful song. ""Virus"" is great for its lyrics and the tune. The other songs are good as well, but those three are the ones that stand out the most in my mind.This CD isn't the best I've ever heard, but it definitely is not the worst. It's not the most original, but it is far from generic. It's an above average CD and is a great treat for anyone who likes Heather Nova.",1

I have read and enjoyed other Culture Shock books before (Culture Shock Malaysia is wonderful and very helpful) but I was blown away by this book's awfulness. It should have been called, ""Out-dated Personal Ramblings of a Typo-prone Journalist in China."" Sarcasm is rampant, the author refers to the reader as ""pal"" and frequently admonishes him (as in, ""too bad, pal. China isn't going to change for you."") and the vast majority of the so-called advice is terribly outdated.The Culture Shock people should take this book off the market before it seriously damages their name.",0

I barely made it through the 2-hour pilot, but boy am I glad that I stuck it out for a little while. It takes a while for the show to get off the ground, but when it does it sure takes off running. By the end of Season 1 you'll learn to love Peter, Olivia, Walter, and Astroid errr...

Relationships are left hanging. The problem, for me, was that there was never a thread to join the characters. The end was left hanging with a question mark. The general plot was all too murky without people to engage with. I do not think this was a good read.",0

4966,"Might as well have been called ""Cafe Montana"": Other than a few tracks with Italian acid jazz-like lyrics (one in a dialect that was incomprehensible) it's mostly instrumental, and not that great. Hip Musak is what this really is. If you're looking for cool Italian music, save your money and get some San Remo Festival CDs (available at amazon.com). If you want to feel like you've turned on the smooth jazz station that plays Kenny G., this is the album for you!",0
4967,"Spend a little more and get a good saw.: I should have spent another 100 bucks and bought a better quality saw. No such thing as a bargin! The Delta 10"" table saw is a poorly made product produced in Tiawan. Out of the box the blade needed adjustment. The adjustment mechanism is hard to reach. I had to max out the adjustment to square the blade. The table top does not have grooves or lines to align the fence. The fence moves a 1/16"" when I tighten it. I have to measure from blade to fence for every cut. The motor vibrates when cutting any board thicker then 1 1/2"" resulting in an uneven cut. Even if you're a beginner looking for an entry level saw...don't buy this saw. You'll be frustrated. A good carpenter doesn't blame his tools...but with this poorly designed and made saw I'll make an exception. I regret buying this saw.",0

I use it together with ""Kerastase Nutritive Lait Nutri Sculpt Smoothing Hair Foundation Dry and Sensitived Hair"" I just use a little bit of each and my hair becomes managable. Right now, I have shoulder lenght hair that has soft and smooth waves with no frizz thanks to these products.

4977,"DON'T BE MISLEAD BY THE OTHER REVIEWS!: I usually read the reviews about a product before I buy something I'm unsure of. After reading several of the most helpful reviews I decided to purchace these headphones. I've never been more dissatisfied with a product I've purchased from Amazon. All of the good reviews in my opinion are coming from people who have damaged their ears, and/or don't mind the obvious and annoying feeback, the instability of the connection, and the bursts of volume shooting into your ear because of that instability. The tuner/channels/volume are the only control's you have beside the range and other things causing interferance. And after an hour of trying to get the darn things to stay clear using the channel/tuner/volume, I had no success, and only much frustration and pain due to speaker shreiks as I call them. So I quit, and am sending them back. I would write more but I have to split. Bottom line, buy at your own risk. ~Seraph",0

4984,"A Stoner/Drug Movie For Non-Stoners: What a delight. I saw parts of it on Comedy Central and laughed very hard, and then purchased the DVD and was able to enjoy a very silly little movie that will make you laugh. If you enjoyed Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, then this movie is for you. Cameos: Kevin Pollack and Thomas Haden Church (director) play DEA agents with a confused bad cop/crazy cop schtick that's very amusing. Thomas Haden Church also plays a state trooper in an earlier scene, as well. And finally, Rip Torn as an old man named ""Oldman"" adds some tenderness to the film. At the very least, rent this. What do you have to lose? 4 bucks and 2 hours? I highly recommend this DVD. Be warned, there are no special features to speak of and no subtitles, without those, I give this a four and a half. Enjoy!",1
4985,"Where's Chuck?: This could have been an incredible album (much like Grand Funk's ""Bosnia"" album) and a tribute to one of the best groups of the 70's. Sadly, it is missing one ingredient, Chuck Negron. Cory Wells is a great soloist (Mama Told Me Not To Come)and Danny Hutton has his moments (Liar) but hearing Danny attempting to sing ""One"", Joy To The World, and ""Easy To Be Hard"" is too much to ask for those familiar with the originals (all three songs and many of their other hits were originally sung by Chuck). The production is great, Richie Podolor, the original producer still has the touch and the harmonies are impeccable. But this album should be called ""Two Dog Night"", and not ""Three Dog Night"" since one-third of the original group is missing. Here's hoping they re-unite (soon) and give the fans what they deserve, a band that can rival the original group.",0
4986,"All Good: Not one bad cut. The great thing about this album is you can take each of the musicians singly and explore what they are doing. Listen to Jeff Beck...not on ""Hello Jeff"" (actually DO listen to that too!) but on ""Journey to Love"". His haunting solo fits perfectly with the mood of the song...and gives it the Beck Edge. George Duke glides throughout. David Sanctious (sp?) is a monster...not just on keyboard but guitar as well. From Stanley's original ""Stanley Clarke"" through this album and then to ""School Days"" this three album era was Stanley stepping out and rippin it up.",1

The only thing I found disturbing was the statement that ""typical life for foam cushions is 6 months"".

The meat of the book is the reality check, good information for professionals going on assignment. I just returned from India, that chapter is a must read for anyone going there.
